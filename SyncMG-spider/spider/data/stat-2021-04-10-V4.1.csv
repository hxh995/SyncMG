We do not fully understand how important types (species) of bacteria and packages of genetic material (genes) coding for antibiotic resistance move between humans, animals and the environment, or where, how and why antibiotic resistance emerges. This study aims to look in detail at the genetic level at bacteria in farm animals, human/animal sewage, sewage treatment works and rivers, to work out the complex network of transmission of important antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes. We will use this information to work out how best to slow down the spread of antibiotic resistance between humans, livestock and the environment.

STUDY BACKGROUND AND AIMS IN MORE DETAIL
Infections are one of the most common causes of ill-health in human and animal medicine, and are caused by a range of different micro-organisms, including viruses and bacteria. Amongst bacteria, there are some species, or types, of bacteria, which can live harmlessly in human and animal intestines, sewage, and rivers, but can also cause disease in humans and animals if they get into the wrong body space, such as the bloodstream or urine. Examples of these bacteria include E. coli, and other similar organisms, which belong to a family of bacteria called ""Enterobacteriaceae"".It has generally been possible to treat infections caused by bacteria using several classes of medicines, known as antibiotics. Different antibiotics kill bacteria in different ways: for example, they can switch off critical chemical processes that the bacteria need to survive, or they can break down the outer shell of the bacteria. In response to the use of antibiotics, bacteria have changed over time, finding ways to alter their structure so that antibiotics no longer have a target to act on, or by producing substances that break down the antibiotic before it has a chance to kill the bacteria. These changes to the bacteria's genetic code, so that they are no longer killed by an antibiotic, create antibiotic resistance. Bacteria can also acquire packages of genes that cause antibiotic resistance from other surrounding bacteria. This is known as horizontal gene transfer. Through these mechanisms, members of the Enterobacteriaceae family of bacteria have developed antibiotic resistance to a number of different antibiotics over a short period of time. In some cases we are no longer able to treat these infections with the antibiotics we have available.Studying antibiotic resistance and horizontal gene transfer in bacteria found in humans, animals and the environment is difficult because we cannot directly see how bacteria and their genetic material move between them. However, new ""Next Generation Sequencing"" (NGS) technologies allow scientists to look in great detail at the genetic code of large numbers of bacteria. Comparing this information across bacteria which have been living in the different parts of the environment (e.g. sewage treatment works, rivers) and in human and animal sewage allows us to see how bacteria have evolved to become resistant to antibiotics, and how resistance genes have been shared between them.This study will use NGS technologies to look at the genetic code of large numbers of Enterobacteriaceae bacteria found in humans, animals (pigs, sheep and poultry), sewage (pre-, during and post-treatment), and rivers. These different groups/areas will be sampled in different seasons of one calendar year to determine how antibiotic resistance genes move around between these locations and over time, and what factors might influence this movement. We will also be investigating whether various chemicals and nutrients in the water may be affecting how quickly horizontal gene transfer occurs. Understanding this is essential to work out how we might intervene more effectively to slow the spread of antibiotic resistance genes and bacteria, and keep our antibiotic medicines useful.","Detailed study at the genetic level at bacteria in farm animals, human/animal sewage, sewage treatment works and rivers, to work out the complex network of transmission of important antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes",SUBMITTED,2021-03-04T03:59:46,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005495/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005495/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005495/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Mixed', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Mixed'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005495/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005495/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005495/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005495,4.1,root:Mixed

                microbial community composition in environmental samples. 18S rDNA pyrosequencing
                has revealed a vast diversity of infrequent sequences, leading to the proposition of
                the existence of an extremely diverse microbial ""rare biosphere"". While rare
                microbes no doubt exist, critical views suggest that many rare sequences may
                actually be artifacts. However, information about how diversity revealed by
                molecular methods relates to that revealed by classical morphology approaches is
                practically non-existent. To address this issue, we used different approaches to
                assess the diversity of tintinnid ciliates, a species-rich group in which species
                can be easily distinguished morphologically. We studied two Mediterranean marine
                samples with different patterns of tintinnid diversity. We estimated tintinnid
                diversity in these samples employing morphological observations as well as both
                classical cloning and sequencing and pyrosequencing of two different markers, the
                18S rDNA and the ITS regions, applying a variety of computational approaches
                currently used to analyze pyrosequence reads. We found that both molecular
                approaches were efficient in detecting the tintinnid species observed by microscopy
                and revealed similar phylogenetic structures of the tintinnid community at the
                species level. However, depending on the method used to analyze the pyrosequencing
                results, we observed discrepancies with the morphology-based assessments up to
                several orders of magnitude. In several cases, the inferred number of operational
                taxonomic units (OTUs) largely exceeded the total number of tintinnid cells in the
                samples. Such inflation of the OTU numbers corresponded to ""rare biosphere"" taxa,
                composed largely of artefacts. Our results suggest that a careful and rigorous
                analysis of pyrosequencing datasets, including data denoising and sequence
                clustering with well-adjusted parameters, is necessary to accurately describe

Although many studies have characterized the human microbiome, far less is known about the skin microbiome of non-human mammals. The objective of this research was to create a baseline skin microbiome dataset for the Mammalia class, testing the effects of species, location, hygiene, body region, and biological sex. The back, torso, and inner thigh regions of 187 non-human mammals and 20 human participants were collected to include representatives from 38 species and 10 mammalian orders. Animals were collected from local farms, zoos, households, and the wild. All samples were amplified using the V3-V4 16S rRNA gene region and sequenced using a MiSeq (Illumina). Human skin was significantly less diverse than all other mammalian orders according to Shannon indices (6.54 versus 3.96, p < 0.001). The factor most strongly associated with community variation for all samples was whether the host was a human (PERMANOVA, F = 37.8, p < 0.001; Figure 2). By analyzing all samples together, random forest modelling identified that human and animal samples could be distinguished correctly 98.51.2% of the time. This study represents the largest mammalian skin microbiome project to date and is the first study to elucidate the skin microbiota for 32 distinct species. Additionally, these findings are the first to demonstrate that human skin is distinct, not only distinct from other Primates, but from all 10 mammalian orders sampled.

Here, we analyzed the effect of sampling from different parts of the same stool specimen or on different consecutive days, as well as short-term storage of samples at different temperatures on microbiome profiles obtained by 16S rRNA gene amplification. Each of these factors had relatively little effect on the microbial composition. In addition, replicate amplification of 44 stool samples showed reproducible results.

We developed a generalizable model-guided framework to predict higher-dimensional consortia from time-resolved measurements of lower-order assemblages. This method was employed to decipher microbial interactions in a diverse human gut microbiome synthetic community. We show that pairwise interactions are major drivers of multi-species community dynamics, as opposed to higher-order interactions. The inferred ecological network exhibits a high proportion of negative and frequent positive interactions. Ecological drivers and responsive recipient species were discovered in the network. Our model demonstrated that a prevalent positive and negative interaction topology enables robust coexistence by implementing a negative feedback loop that balances disparities in monospecies fitness levels. We show that negative interactions could generate history-dependent responses of initial species proportions that frequently do not originate from bistability. Measurements of extracellular metabolites illuminated the metabolic capabilities of monospecies and potential molecular basis of microbial interactions.

Here, we elucidated the mechanistic interactions among dietary fiber, the gut microbiota and the protective colonic mucus barrier that is one of the hosts first lines of defence. We employed a tractable approach consisting of a synthetic community of fully sequenced human gut bacteria assembled in gnotobiotic mice. The members of this community were selected to represent the phylogenetic diversity in a complete microbiota, but also based on empirical knowledge of their abilities to degrade various fiber polysaccharides and mucin glycans in vitro. The responses of this synthetic microbiota, and the corresponding impact on the host colonic mucus layer, to variation of dietary fiber were monitored by multiple readouts in conditions where mice were fed constant high- or low-fiber diets or daily alternations of the two. We show that starvation of dietary fiber diminishes the colonic mucus barrier by enhancing the activities of mucin-degrading bacteria. One-day alternations of the fiber-rich and fiber-free diets or feeding of a prebiotic diet still displayed thinner mucus barriers reflecting a residual increase in mucus-degrading bacteria and their mucin glycan-degrading enzymes.

Here we aimed to determine whether turf grass soil bacterial communities were associated with human population density across a range of greenspaces in parks, streets, and residential areas across a major urban area. Results showed that bacterial diversity was significantly positively correlated with population density within the immediate vicinity of the sampled areas; and species diversity was greater in park and street soils, when compared with residential zones. Population density and greenspace type (park vs street vs residential area) also associated with the composition and structure of the bacterial community. Edaphic properties, including pH, moisture and texture, were also significantly correlated with microbial composition and structure. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that microbial guilds in urban soils were well connected. Soil moisture and texture together with population density and greenspace type showed strong correlations with several network topological features including assortativity degree, edge density, average path, average betweenness and closeness.

In response to antibiotics, cutaneous populations exhibited an immediate and long-term shift in bacterial residents. By contrast, antiseptics elicited only minor changes to underlying communities.

These particular inhabitants were also shown to compete with Staphylococcus aureus for colonization at the skin surface, a stable effect which extended to multiple resident Staphylococcus species.

A challenge is to complement these efforts with a preclinical research pipeline that tests the degree to which a person's physiologic or pathological phenotype can be ascribed to their microbiome and that offers an opportunity to evaluate potential strategies for microbiome-based therapeutics. Here we illustrate such a pre-clinical pipeline by transplanting previously frozen, uncultured fecal microbiota samples from four sets of adult female mono- and dizygotic twins discordant for obesity into groups of adult germ-free C57Bl/6J mice fed a low-fat, plant polysaccharide-rich diet. Capture of a human donor's microbiota in recipient mice is highly reproducible within and between experiments. The increased adiposity phenotype of obese co-twins is transmissible not only with the intact uncultured fecal communities, but with bacterial culture collections generated from these fecal samples. Co-housing mice five days after they received transplants of culture collections from the obese or lean member of a discordant twin pair ameliorated the increased adiposity phenotype that normally develops in recipients of the obese donor's culture collection, while having no effect on the adiposity phenotype of recipients of the lean co-twin's culture collection. These results correlate with taxonomic and metabolic changes in co-housed mice harboring the obese co-twin's culture collection.

For example, forensic entomology is widely used to assess PMI, but errors can range on the scale of days, weeks or season depending on the scenario1. Limitations of forensic entomology include uncertainty in the interval between death and initial egg deposition2, lack of insects during particular weather events or seasons3, and regionally specific blowfly larval growth curves and insect communities4. Microbes may provide a novel method for estimating PMI that might avoid many of these limitations, because microbes are ubiquitous in the environment, located on humans before death, and can be reliably quantified using high-throughput DNA sequencing. However, the feasibility of using microbes forensically has yet to be rigorously tested, and we must determine whether microbial community change is sufficiently measurable and directional during decomposition to allow accurate predictions. Here, we show that postmortem microbial community changes are dramatic, measurable, and repeatable in a mouse model system, allowing estimates of PMI to within ~3 days over 48 days, and provide insight into the ecological factors underlying succession of bacteria and microbial eukaryotes within the decomposing corpse system.

The MICHAm (MIcrobial ecology of Confined Habitats and humAn health, modified) study aimed to survey the microbial distribution and its community structure within the facility from the start to the end of the simulation study, and to investigate the impact of confinement. Therefore, the microbial load and biodiversity in the air and on surfaces as well as their changes over time were monitored.The cultivation approach showed that the overall microbial inventory in the air and on different surfaces was moderate compared to other non-confined rooms (air: 0 to 716 CFU/m3; average=86 CFU/m3; surface: 0 to 29,760 CFU/10 m2; average=675 CFU/10 m2). Despite the detection of fluctuations in microbial load over time and places, microbial hotspots were identified. Phylogenetic investigations revealed a higher diversity on surfaces than in air indicating the dominance of human-associated microorganisms (e.g. staphylococci). Besides cultivation-based analyses, the microbial community was also studied on the molecular level via PhyloChip analysis and next generation sequencing. The whole microbiome structure exhibited a significant change in structure and decrease in diversity over time, but potentially pathogenic microorganisms containing mobile elements increased during the confinement. Additionally, significantly different microbiome structures were identified for investigated modules.Since the majority of microorganisms were not harmful there was no alert and health concern due to potential danger caused by microorganisms.

We examined whether genetic variation in animal behavior could affect the composition of the animals microbiota in different environments. The freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna is primarily planktonic, but exhibits variation in the degree to which it browses in benthic sediments. We performed an experiment with clonal lines of D. magna showing different levels of sediment-browsing intensity exposed to either bacteria-rich or bacteria-poor sediment or whose access to sediments was prevented. We find that the bacterial composition of the environment and genotype-specific browsing intensity together influence the composition of the Daphnia-associated bacterial community. Exposure to more diverse bacteria did not lead to a more diverse microbiome, but greater abundances of environment-specific bacteria were found associated with host genotypes that exhibited greater browsing behavior.

Treatment has been limited by a lack of understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Stunting is most likely associated with changes in the microbial community of the small intestine, a compartment vital for digestion and nutrient absorption. Efforts to better understand the pathophysiology have been hampered by difficulty of access to small intestinal fluids. Here, we describe for the first time the microbial community found in the upper gastrointestinal tract of stunted children. We studied 46 duodenal and 57 gastric samples from stunted children as well as 404 fecal samples from stunted and non-stunted children aged 2-5 years living in Bangui, Central African Republic and in Antananarivo, Madagascar, using 16S Illumina Amplicon sequencing and semi-quantitative culture methods. The vast majority of the stunted children showed small intestinal bacterial overgrowth dominated by bacteria that normally reside in the oropharyngeal cavity. There was an overrepresentation of oral bacteria in fecal samples of stunted children opening the way for developing non-invasive diagnostic markers. In addition, E. coli/Shigella sp. and Campylobacter sp. were found to be more prevalent in stunted children, while Clostridia, well-known butyrate producers, were reduced. Our data suggest that stunting is associated with a microbiome decompartmentalization of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by an increased presence of oropharyngeal bacteria from the stomach to the colon, hence challenging the current view of stunting arising solely as a consequence of small intestine overstimulation through recurrent infections by enteric pathogens.",Stunted childhood growth is associated with decompartmentalization of the gastrointestinal tract and overgrowth of oropharyngeal taxa,SUBMITTED,2020-06-14T15:01:53,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005526/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005526/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005526/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005526/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005526/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005526/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005526,4.1,root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system

However, very little is known about the impact of season on the dynamics of the microbiota in a pig farm setting. Methods: We performed a longitudinal study, investigating the changes in the nasal microbiota of different samples collected in the four seasons (winter, spring, summer and fall). We collected samples from 30 pig farms in Switzerland in each season from 2014-2015. This included nasal swabs from pigs (n=225), air samples taken in the pig confinement building (n=105), and nasal swabs from pig farmers working in these pig farms (n=154 from 48 pig farmers). As controls, nasal swabs from cow farmers (n=56 from 18 cow farmers) and individuals with no contact with farm animals (n=69 from 24 non-exposed individuals) were collected. Analysis of the microbiota was performed based on 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing utilizing the Illumina MiSeq platform and the recently developed DADA2 pipeline. Results: Alpha-diversity values were generally higher in samples received in winter with the exception of samples from the non-exposed controls which displayed low alpha-diversity values throughout the seasons with no significant differences. The microbial structure of pig farmers, cow farmers and non-exposed individuals was significantly influenced by season. Also, the farm where the samples were taken from influenced the nasal microbiota of pig and cow farmers. There was a stronger similarity for samples that originated from the same farm as compared to samples from different farms in winter and this farm-specificity was partially or completely lost in spring, summer and fall.Conclusions: Nasal microbiota of pig farmers is affected by the regular exposure to pigs throughout the year. However, season has a very strong effect on the nasal microbiota of pig farmers, pigs, and cow farmers, as well as the airborne bacterial composition.

We have previously demonstrated a significant association between the placental microbiome and risk of preterm birth, as well as (in non-pregnant subjects) association of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants (mtSNPs) with the vaginal and gut microbiome. In this study, we aimed to explore complex interactions between human host mtSNPs and the vaginal and placental membrane microbiome with associated risk of preterm birth.Methods: Maternal blood and placental tissue samples from 93 gravidae (n=54 with preterm deliveries between 23 and 0/7 and <37 and 0/7 weeks; n=39 term =37 and 0/7 weeks) were deep sequenced, and mtSNPs were called with high confidence. The microbial taxonomic abundance of the vagina (introitus and posterior fornix) and placental membranes (maternal and fetal side swabs) from the same subjects were obtained via 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing, and inferred metagenomics was employed for metabolic pathway analysis. Interactions among both microbial taxa and their inferred metagenomics pathways were examined for association with mtSNPs employing multiple linear regressions modeling for both genotype and clinical covariates with PLINK quantitative trait associations. Analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons, with a q value <0.05 denoting significance.Results: Consistent with ours and others recent published observations, we observed an association between preterm birth and the composition of the placental membrane microbiome community (PERMANOVA p=0.042). In our cohort, no significant association between any mtSNP with the occurrence of preterm birth was observed. However, overall associations between mitochondrial genome variations and both the vaginal and placental membrane preterm microbial community were observed. Of note, several functional mtSNPs (within coding regions for electron transport genes) demonstrated significant and robust associations (q value <0.05) with both occurrence and abundance of certain taxa and their metagenomics pathways among preterm births.Conclusions: We have demonstrated for the first time that maternally inherited human mtSNPs are associated with variations in both placental membrane and vaginal microbial taxa membership and their inferred metabolic function during pregnancy, and consequentially linked to the occurrence of preterm birth.",Integrated Analysis of mtDNA Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms with the Vaginal and Placental Membrane Microbiome and Rendered Risk Estimation for Preterm Birth,HARVESTED,2020-06-14T13:37:08,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005527/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005527/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005527/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005527/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005527/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005527/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005527,4.1,root:Host-associated:Human

These adjacent regions show one of the most contrasting socio-economical differences in the world.OBJECTIVE:We explored changes in allergy from school age to young adulthood from 2003 to 2010/2012 in these two areas. The skin and nasal microbiota were also compared.METHODS:Randomly selected children from Finnish (n = 98) and Russian Karelia (n = 82) were examined in 2003, when the children were 7-11 years of age, and again in 2010 (Finnish Karelia) and 2012 (Russian Karelia). We analysed self-reported allergy symptoms and sensitization to common allergens by serum sIgE values. The skin (volar forearm) and nasal mucosa microbiota, collected in 2012 (aged 15-20 years), identified from DNA samples, were compared with multivariate methods.RESULTS:Asthma, hay fever, atopic eczema, self-reported rhinitis, as well as atopic sensitization, were threefold to 10-fold more common in Finland, as compared to Russian Karelia. Hay fever and peanut sensitization were almost non-existent in Russia. These patterns remained throughout the 10-year follow-up. Skin microbiota, as well as bacterial and fungal communities in nasal mucosa, was contrastingly different between the populations, best characterized by the diversity and abundance of genus Acinetobacter; more abundant and diverse in Russia. Overall, diversity was significantly higher among Russian subjects (Pskin < 0.0001, Pnasal-bacteria < 0.0001 and Pnasal-fungi < 0.01). Allergic diseases were not associated with microbial diversity in Finnish subjects.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE:Differences in allergic phenotype, developed in early life, remain between populations.

Hawaiian anchialine habitats in the Cape Kinau region of Maui and the Kona region of Hawaii exhibit distinctive, laminated orange cyanobacterial-bacterial crusts, but little is known about their composition, the composition of microbial communities in non-crust containing sites lacking the cyanobacterial-bacterial crusts, or the degree to which environmental factors structure them. During the summer of 2010, we surveyed benthic and water column microbial communities from ten anchialine habitats on Oahu, Maui, and Hawaii using high-throughput amplicon sequencing of the V6 (prokaryotic-biased) and V9 (eukaryotic-biased) hypervariable regions of the SSU rRNA gene.

We survey bacterial and archaeal communities in phylogenetically diverse Australian corals representing more than 425 million years of diversification. We show that corals exhibit anatomical compartmentalization of the microbiome such that the coral surface mucus layer, tissue, and skeleton microbiomes show distinct modern microbial ecology and evolutionary assembly. In corals, these compartments differ greatly in microbial community composition, richness, and response to host vs. environmental drivers. We also find evidence of coral-microbe phylosymbiosis, in which coral microbiome composition and richness reflects coral phylogeny. Surprisingly, the coral skeleton represents the most biodiverse coral microbiome, and also shows the strongest evidence of phylosymbiosis.

Here, we report the largest known consolidated study of geothermal ecosystems to determine factors that influence biogeographical patterns. We measured bacterial and archaeal community composition, 46 physicochemical parameters, and metadata from 925 geothermal springs across New Zealand (13.9100.6 C and pH <19.7). We determined that diversity is primarily influenced by pH at temperatures <70 C; with temperature only having a significant effect for values >70 C. Further, community dissimilarity increases with geographic distance, with niche selection driving assembly at a localised scale. Surprisingly, two genera (Venenivibrio and Acidithiobacillus) dominated in both average relative abundance (11.2% and 11.1%, respectively) and prevalence (74.2% and 62.9%, respectively).

IgA responses to several bacterial taxa, including Enterobacteriaceae, correlated with anthropometric measurements of nutritional status in longitudinal studies. The relationship between IgA responses and growth was further explained by enteropathogen burden. Gnotobiotic mouse recipients of an IgA+ bacterial consortium purified from the gut microbiota of undernourished children exhibited a diet-dependent enteropathy characterized by rapid disruption of the small intestinal and colonic epithelial barrier, weight loss, and sepsis that could be prevented by administering two IgA-targeted bacterial species from a healthy microbiota. Dissection of a culture collection of 11 IgA-targeted strains from an undernourished donor, sufficient to transmit these phenotypes, disclosed that Enterobacteriaceae interacted with other consortium members to produce enteropathy.

We tested the ability of plant invasion and diversity theories to address these questions. From a row crop experiment to which management treatments had been applied for 22 years, soil was collected from three systems representing different resource inputs: no input (low resource), conventional (moderate resource), and organic (high resource) systems.

Since carbon dioxide has been detected as one of the most relevant drivers of global climate change, its potential storage and fate in soils has become key for predicting climate scenarios. Unfortunately, studies with a focus on the decomposition and driving factors are still lacking for precise modelling of the fluxes in a changing world. The main actors of carbon degradation in soils have not been fully identified, especially in regard to bacteria very little is known about their contribution to degradation of persistent carbon components. In the present study, the active microbial community involved in degrading 13C-labelled cellulose and lignin in forest soils was identified using a DNA stable isotopic probing (SIP) approach. Microbial activity assessed by measurements of 13CO2 increased with labelled substrate addition, during a 28 days incubation period. Within the vast microbial communities, bacterial and fungal members specialized in degrading cellulose (e.g. Devosia (Rhizobiales), Sebacinales), lignin (e.g. Sphingopyxis (Sphingomonadales), Paucibacter (Burkholderiales), Xylariales, Auriculariales, Helotiales), and both substrates (e.g. Caulobacter (Caulobacterales), Schizoporaceae, Orbiliales) have been identified. Over the course of the experiment, a successional shift from early degrading colonizers (e.g. Brevundimonas (Caulobacterales), Trichosporonales, Hymenochaetales, Gomphales) to late stage beneficiary microorganisms (e.g. Sphingopyxis (Sphingomonadales), Devosia (Rhizobiales), Orbiliales) became evident.

Interactions between the gut microbiome and fecal bile acid composition as a factor in colorectal cancer neoplasia have been postulated but evidence is limited to small cohorts and animal studies. Using banked stool samples collected as part of a phase III randomized clinical trial of UDCA for the prevention of colorectal adenomatous polyps, we compared change in the microbiome composition after a 3-year intervention in a subset of participants randomized to oral UDCA at 8-10 mg/kg of body weight per day (n = 198) or placebo (n = 203). Study participants randomized to UDCA experienced compositional changes in their microbiome that were statistically more similar to other individuals in the UDCA arm than to those in the placebo arm. This reflected a UDCA-associated shift in microbial community composition (P < 0.001), independent of sex, with no evidence of a UDCA effect on microbial richness (P > 0.05). These UDCA-associated shifts in microbial community distance metrics from baseline to end-of-study were not associated with risk of any or advanced adenoma (all P > 0.05) in men or women. Separate analyses of microbial networks revealed an overrepresentation of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in the post-UDCA arm and an inverse relationship between F prausnitzii and Ruminococcus gnavus. In men who received UDCA, the overrepresentation of F prausnitzii and underrepresentation of R gnavus were more prominent in those with no adenoma recurrence at follow-up compared to men with recurrence. This relationship was not observed in women. Daily UDCA use modestly influences the relative abundance of microbial species in stool and affects the microbial network composition with suggestive evidence for sex-specific effects of UDCA on stool microbial community composition as a modifier of colorectal adenoma risk.[This text is derived from our Open Access publication of the same title as this project.]",Effects of ursodeoxycholic acid on the gut microbiome and colorectal adenoma development.,HARVESTED,2020-05-02T02:23:31,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005198/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005198/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005198/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Fecal'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005198/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005198/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005198/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005198,4.1,root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal

Detailed knowledge of this microbiota is, therefore, of importance for the dairy industry. In this study, the bacterial composition of consumption milk was assessed during different stages in the production line and throughout the storage in cartons by using culturing techniques and 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing. Monthly samples from two dairies were analyzed to capture the seasonal variations in the milk microbiota. Although there was a core microbiota present in milk samples from both dairies, the composition of the bacterial communities were significantly influenced by sampling month, processing stage and storage temperature. Overall, a higher abundance of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) within the order Bacillales was detected in samples of raw and pasteurized milk from the spring and summer months, while Pseudomonadales and Lactobacillales OTUs were predominant in the winter months. OTUs belonging to the order Lactobacillales, Pseudomonadales, Clostridiales and Bacillales were significantly more abundant in milk samples taken immediately after pasteurization compared to raw milk samples. During storage of milk in cartons at 4 C, the bacterial composition remained stable throughout the product shelf life, while storage at 8 C significantly increased the abundance of OTUs belonging to the genus Bacillus and the plate count levels of presumptive Bacillus cereus.

Here we present the targeted sequencing of the microbial 16S rRNA gene of clinically relevant gut microorganisms as a method to provide a gut screening test that could assist in the clinical diagnosis of certain health conditions. We evaluated the possibility of detecting 46 clinical prokaryotic targets in the human gut, 28 of which could be identified with high precision and sensitivity by a bioinformatics pipeline that includes sequence analysis and taxonomic annotation. These targets included 20 commensal, 3 beneficial (probiotic), and 5 pathogenic intestinal microbial taxa. Using stool microbiome samples from a cohort of 897 healthy individuals, we established a reference range defining clinically relevant relative levels for each of the 28 targets. Our assay quantifies 28 targets in the context of a healthy reference range and correctly reflected 38/38 verification samples of real and synthetic stool material containing known gut pathogens.

Two most dominant mycorrhizal types in temperate forests, arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal plant species, can drive distinct dynamics in which the composition of the fungal community changes due to associations with plant community composition, and these changes differentially feed back on plant growth through the effects of (i) plant-fungus compatibility and (ii) common fungal networks. Here we investigate how plant community development is linked with mycorrhizal types, contrasting the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) versus ectomycorrhizal (EcM) associations on seedling establishment. By simulating the scenario where established tree community modifies the soil fungal component (i.e., AM versus EcM inocula) and alters the competitive environment for new seedlings, we found that competition for soil nutrients influenced seedling establishment. The results showed that compatible seedlings had significantly greater leaf and root biomasses than incompatible seedlings, a benefit from the presence of established competitors through enhancing positive nutrient feedbacks. While plant-soil feedback mediated tree-seedling interactions for both AM and EcM associations, the estimated compatibility effects were more positive for EcM relative to AM associations. Notably, this coincided with the more pronounced sharing of fungal species and more structured formation of common fungal network in EcM systems compared to AM systems. Together these results suggest the link between seedling establishment and mycorrhizal functional differentiation.",Contrasting the roles of mycorrhizal compatibility in community development between arbuscular- versus ecto-mycorhizal systems,HARVESTED,2020-02-14T14:33:40,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005153/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005153/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005153/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Plants:Root', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Plants:Root'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005153/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005153/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005153/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005153,4.1,root:Host-associated:Plants:Root

Like several other immune-mediated diseases, asthma pathogenesis is being studied in the context of the hygiene hypothesis. Antibiotic-driven gut microbial shifts exclusively in the neonatal period increase airway inflammation in mice. We hypothesized that similar microbial changes in infant humans have a causal role in disease. To test this, 319 children enrolled in the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) study were grouped into four phenotypes: atopic + wheeze (AW), atopic only, wheeze only, and controls, based on clinical data at 1 year. The fecal microbiome of 3-month and 1-year samples was evaluated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing (Illumina). A subset of samples in the AW and control groups was selected for qPCR, short chain fatty acid (SCFA) and urine metabolomic analyses. Finally, germ-free mice were inoculated with feces from one AW patient or with the same inoculum plus 4 bacterial strains found more commonly in controls. These mice were bred and the F1 generation was evaluated for OVA-induced airway inflammation. Results: At 3 months of age, 4 OTUs were identified by sequencing and qPCR as decreased in AW children, who also had a significantly increased risk of asthma diagnosis, based on their asthma predictive index at 3 years of age. These children exhibited decreased fecal acetate and propionate, and alterations in bacterial and host-derived metabolites mostly at 3 months of age. Finally, oral inoculation of mice with these 4 bacterial strains ameliorated airway inflammation. These results reveal taxonomic and functional gut microbial changes in infants associated with an increased risk of asthma. Decreased production of SCFA at this young age may lead to changes in energy harvest, bile acid and urobilinogen metabolism. This study suggests an associative and possibly causal role of early infancy shifts in gut microbiota with risk of asthma in human infants.",CHILD gut microbiome and asthma,SUBMITTED,2020-02-10T16:25:51,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005233/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005233/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005233/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Mammals:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Mammals:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Fecal'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005233/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005233/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005233/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005233,4.1,root:Host-associated:Mammals:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal

A challenge is to complement these efforts with a preclinical research pipeline that tests the degree to which a person's physiologic or pathological phenotype can be ascribed to their microbiome and that offers an opportunity to evaluate potential strategies for microbiome-based therapeutics. Here we illustrate such a pre-clinical pipeline by transplanting previously frozen, uncultured fecal microbiota samples from four sets of adult female mono- and dizygotic twins discordant for obesity into groups of adult germ-free C57Bl/6J mice fed a low-fat, plant polysaccharide-rich diet. Capture of a human donor's microbiota in recipient mice is highly reproducible within and between experiments. The increased adiposity phenotype of obese co-twins is transmissible not only with the intact uncultured fecal communities, but with bacterial culture collections generated from these fecal samples. Co-housing mice five days after they received transplants of culture collections from the obese or lean member of a discordant twin pair ameliorated the increased adiposity phenotype that normally develops in recipients of the obese donor's culture collection, while having no effect on the adiposity phenotype of recipients of the lean co-twin's culture collection. These results correlate with taxonomic and metabolic changes in co-housed mice harboring the obese co-twin's culture collection.

However, specific microbes or microbial communities that can be mechanistically linked to cervical carcinogenesis remain largely unexplored. The purpose of the study was to examine the association between cervical microbiota and high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2+) in women infected with high-risk (HR) human papillomaviruses (HPV) and to assess whether the cervical microbiota are associated with oxidative DNA damage as indicated by the presence of cervical cells positive for 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine. The study included 340 women diagnosed with CIN 2+ (cases) and 90 diagnosed with CIN 1 (non-cases). Microbiota composition was determined by Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene amplified from DNA extracted from cervical mucus samples. Measures of alpha/beta-diversity were not associated with either CIN severity or oxidative DNA damage. However, a cervical mucosal community type (CT) dominated by L. iners and unclassified Lactobacillus spp. was associated with CIN 2+ (OR = 3.48; 95% CI, 1.279.55). Sequence reads mapping to Lactobacillaceae, Lactobacillus, L. reuteri, and several subgenus level Lactobacillus operational taxonomic units were also associated with CIN 2+ when examined independently (effect size >2.0; P < 0.05). Our 16S rRNA sequencing results need confirmation in independent studies using whole-genome shotgun sequencing and that would allow sharpening the suggested associations at finer taxonomic levels. Our results provide little evidence that DNA oxidative damage mediates the effect of the microbiome on the natural history of HPV infection and CIN severity.

The community structure of the putative ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes was possibly more influenced by the host genetic distances than that of the root-associated ascomycetes. This study also indicated that in dipterocarp rainforests, root-associated ascomycetes were characterized by high biodiversity and indistinct host association patterns, whereas ectomycorrhizal fungi showed less biodiversity and a strong host phylogenetic preference for dipterocarp trees. Our findings suggested that root-associated ascomycetes (e.g., root-endophytic ascomycetes, may have biodiversity hotspots in the tropics, whereas biodiversity of ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes increased with host phylogenetic diversity.",Contrasting diversity and host association of ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes versus root-associated ascomycetes in a dipterocarp rainforest,HARVESTED,2020-02-10T10:25:27,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005160/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005160/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005160/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Plants:Root', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Plants:Root'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005160/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005160/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005160/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005160,4.1,root:Host-associated:Plants:Root

We conducted a large-scale field experiment to disentangle the effects of genotype, environment, age, and year of harvest on bacterial communities associated with leaves and roots of Boechera stricta, a wild perennial mustard.  Genetic control of the microbiome varied substantially among sites, and bacterial community composition shifted as plants aged.

Enterobacterales are a particular AMR problem, and a common cause of disease. We developed a novel approach for AMR surveillance in Enterobacterales by profiling metagenomes of pooled human faecal material from three sites (n=563 individuals; Cambodia, Kenya, UK) to derive a taxonomy-adjusted AMR metric which could be used to predict the aggregate burden of resistant Enterobacterales infections within each setting. Samples were sequenced (Illumina); taxonomic and resistance gene profiling was performed using ResPipe (https://gitlab.com/hsgweon/ResPipe). Data on organisms causing bacteraemia and meningitis and susceptibility results from 2010-2017 were collated for each site. Bayesian generalised linear models with a binomial likelihood were fitted to determine the capacity of the metric to predict AMR in Enterobacterales infections in each setting. The most informative model predicted the proportion of resistant infections in the target populations for 14/14 of antibiotics in the UK, 12/12 in Kenya, and 8/12 in Cambodia. Intermittent metagenomics of pooled human samples could be a powerful tool in determining and monitoring the burden of AMR in clinical infections, especially in resource-limited settings.",Predicting antibiotic resistance in clinical infections caused by Enterobacterales from aggregated population-level taxonomy-adjusted AMR estimates derived from quantitative metagenomic analysis of pooled human faecal samples,SUBMITTED,2020-02-04T14:43:01,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005128/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005128/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005128/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Fecal'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005128/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005128/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005128/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005128,4.1,root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal

By uncovering pairs of fungi that co-occurred in the same soil samples more/less frequently than expected by chance, networks depicting fine-scale distributions of fungi are inferred at the O and A horizons.

Because microorganisms are key actors of biogeochemical processes and organic matter turnover, we dedicated an important part of these research programs to the characterization of taxonomic and functional responses of the sediment microbiome to hypoxia events. Based on Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies (i.e. ILLUMINA), we developed a metabarcoding approach that aims at exploring taxonomic diversity of Bacteria and Archaea living in the sediment, and we developed a metatranscriptomic approach that aims at identifying metabolic activities and pathways involved in the ecosystem functions. The laboratory experiment considered triplicate samples of sediment at various depth layers and according to oxygenation conditions of the water column ranging from 0% to 100%.",metatranscriptomic approaches to unravel taxonomic and functional diversities of a coastal aquatic ecosystem and their reaction to hypoxia,SUBMITTED,2019-12-11T01:00:54,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005140/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005140/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005140/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Sediment', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Sediment'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005140/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005140/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005140/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005140,4.1,root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Sediment

The lack of metrics for quantifying development of the gut microbiota and mucosal immune system has hindered the ability to dissect the effects of microbial, host and environmental factors on their co-development. Therefore, we subjected fecal samples, collected monthly during the first 3 postnatal years from 40 healthy USA twin pairs, to bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing and to fluorescence-activated cell sorting to distinguish IgA-targeted from non-targeted taxa. Applying a machine-learning algorithm (Random Forests), we identified a set of 25 age-discriminatory bacterial taxa whose patterns of representation define a program of microbiota assembly/maturation shared across twin pairs. Remarkably, IgA responses to 30 taxa, including a subset of the age-discriminatory organisms, converge on a pattern shared across twin pairs by the second postnatal year; the observed targeting patterns were not simple reflections of relative abundance or taxonomy. Zygosity, delivery mode, and breast versus formula feeding had small albeit statistically significant effects on targeting. In follow-up studies, young germ-free mice were colonized with fecal microbiota obtained from two twin pairs at 6 and 18 months of age, and fed a sequence of human diets designed to simulate the transition from milk feeding to complementary foods. Distinct age-associated differences in mucosal IgA responses to the transplanted human microbiota were recapitulated in both diet contexts for both twin pairs, suggesting that intrinsic properties of their community members play a dominant role in dictating IgA responses.  This approach can be used to define gut mucosal immune development in health and disease states, and help identify ways to repair or prevent perturbations in this facet of host immunity.",Characterizing postnatal co-development of the gut microbiota and mucosal IgA responses in healthy twin pairs and a gnotobiotic mouse model,SUBMITTED,2019-12-07T07:43:23,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005142/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005142/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005142/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Fecal'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005142/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005142/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005142/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005142,4.1,root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal

Although anti-gingivitis efficacy of different oral care products has been studied from clinical outcomes, we know little about their impacts on oral microbiota and its metabolic capabilities. Here, ninety one adults underwent controlled transitions from naturally occurring gingivitis, to healthy gingivae using different anti-gingivitis products. Oral care product regimen, which contains stannous chloride in toothpaste and cetylpyridinium chloride in mouthwash, showed significant better anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis efficacy than placebo toothpaste in twenty seven days parallel study. Microbial diversity for regimen group was significantly decreased from Baseline Day 0 to Day 27. Meanwhile, plaque microbiota structure exhibited a continuous transition along the first principal component, which correlated with changes of Mazza Gingival Index and Plaque Index. Thirteen oral bacteria tend to be affected by two antibacterial activess. Metabonomic analysis of saliva indicates reduced anaerobic fermentation and tissue degradation of oral microbiota.

Despite great efforts in streamlining the processes of sequencing and data curation, upstream steps required for amplicon library generation could still influence 16S rRNA gene-based microbial profiles. Among upstream processes, DNA extraction is a critical step that could represent a great source of bias. Accounting for bias introduced by extraction procedures is important when comparing studies that use different methods. Identifying the method that best portrays communities is also desirable. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to evaluate bias introduced by different DNA extraction procedures on oral microbiome profiles.  Design: Four DNA extraction methods were tested on mock communities consisting of seven representative oral bacteria. Additionally, supragingival plaque samples were collected from 7 individuals and divided equally to test two commonly used DNA extraction procedures. Amplicon libraries of the 16S rRNA gene were generated and sequenced via 454-pyrosequencing.  Results: Evaluation of mock communities revealed that DNA yield and bacterial species representation varied with DNA extraction method. Despite producing the lowest yield of DNA, a method that included bead beating was the only protocol able to detect all seven species in the mock community. Comparison of the performance of two commonly used methods (crude lysis and a chemical/enzymatic lysis + column-based DNA isolation) on plaque samples showed no effect of extraction protocols on taxa prevalence but global community structure and relative abundance of individual taxa were affected. At the phylum level, the latter method improved the recovery of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Spirochaetes over crude lysis.  Conclusion: DNA extraction distorts microbial profiles in simulated and clinical oral samples, reinforcing the importance of careful selection of a DNA extraction protocol to improve species recovery and facilitate data comparison across oral microbiology studies.",Influence of DNA extraction on oral microbial profiles obtained via 16S rRNA gene sequencing- Supragingival plaque,HARVESTED,2019-11-07T16:55:38,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001300/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001300/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001300/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Oral:Subgingival plaque', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Oral:Subgingival%20plaque'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001300/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001300/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001300/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001300,3.0|4.1,root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Oral:Subgingival plaque

Using longitudinal assessment of saliva and disease status, we demonstrated that partial least squares modelling of microbial, immunological and clinical measures, grouped children according to future dental disease status. Saliva was collected and dental health assessed in 33 children aged 4 years, and again 1-year later. The composition of the salivary microbiome was assessed and host defense peptides in saliva were quantified. Principle component analysis of the salivary microbiome indicated that children clustered by age and not disease status. Similarly, changes in salivary host defense peptides occurred with age and not in response to, or preceding dental caries. Partial least squares modelling of microbial, immunological and clinical baseline measures clustered children according to future dental disease status. These data demonstrate that isolated evaluation of the salivary microbiome or host response failed to predict dental disease.

The effect of such chronic immunosuppression on the microflora at mucosal surfaces is not known. We evaluated the salivary bacterial microbiome of 20 transplant recipients and 19 non-immunosuppressed controls via 454-pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Alpha-diversity and global community structure did not differ between transplant and control subjects. However, principal coordinate analysis showed differences in community membership. Taxa more prevalent in transplant subjects included operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of potentially opportunistic Gammaproteobacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Acinetobacter sp., Vibrio spp., Enterobacteriaceae sp. and the genera Acinetobacter and Klebsiella. Transplant subjects had increased proportions of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp., Enterobacteriaceae sp. and Enterococcus faecalis, among other OTUs, while increased genera included Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, Staphylococcus and Enterococcus. Furthermore, in transplant subjects, the dose of the immunosuppressant prednisone positively correlated with bacterial richness, while prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil doses positively correlated with the prevalence and proportions of transplant-associated taxa. Correlation network analysis of OTU relative abundance revealed a cluster containing potentially opportunistic pathogens as transplant-associated. This cluster positively correlated with serum levels of C-reactive protein, suggesting a link between the resident flora at mucosal compartments and systemic inflammation. Network connectivity analysis revealed opportunistic pathogens as highly connected to each other and to common oral commensals, pointing to bacterial interactions that may influence colonization.

Our results suggested that distinct bacterial populations in the oral microbiota are involved in production of high levels of H2S and CH3SH in the oral cavity.",Identification of salivary microbiota associated with oral malodor using 16S pyrosequencing,HARVESTED,2019-11-07T16:55:04,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002209/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002209/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002209/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Oral:Saliva', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Oral:Saliva'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002209/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002209/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002209/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002209,4.1,root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Oral:Saliva

Dental caries has a well-established link to discrete, but only partially characterized changes in the dental plaque microbiome. Our study endeavors to define the relative abundance of many species comprising the dental plaque microbiome in twin pairs discordant for dental caries in association and longitudinal studies. The study power afforded by the use of discordant twin pairs for dental caries is substantially greater than similar studies using unrelated individuals. Next, we will compare the caries-free and caries-active microbiomes by deep metagenomic sequencing to identify differentially abundant genes and metabolic pathways. Lastly, we will determine the functional relevance of differentially abundant species, strains and genes by conducting targeted meta-transcriptomic studies. The statistical significance of all of the datasets will be determined which will allow for the widespread identification of species, strains, genes and transcripts associated with dental caries and dental health.

Recent reports in humans and animal models have demonstrated the beneficial therapeutic effects of infections by parasitic worms (helminths) in some inflammatory disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and coeliac disease (CeD). Interestingly, these studies have described how helminths may alter the intestinal microbiota, potentially representing a mechanism by which they regulate inflammation. However, for practical reasons, these reports have primarily analysed the fecal microbiota. In the present investigation, we have assessed, for the first time, the changes in the microbiota at the site of infection by a parasitic helminth (hookworm) and gluten-dependent inflammation in humans with CeD using biopsy tissue from the duodenum. Our results demonstrate that hookworm infection and gluten exposure were associated with increases in the richness and diversity of the tissue-resident microbiota within the intestine.

On the west coast of Australia, the southern distributional limits of several tropical herbivorous fish species, including the rabbitfish Siganus fuscescens, have recently expanded into temperate regions. Microbes are fundamentally important to animal health, demanding an understanding of their variation in studies of animal adaption. Range-shifting S. fuscescens thus provide a unique opportunity to assess the stability of gastrointestinal microbes under varying environmental conditions. Here, the gastrointestinal microbial communities of S. fuscescens were characterised over 2000km of Western Australia's coastline, including in the species' historical and current southern range limit. MiSeq Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene demonstrated that the microbial community differed among populations, and there was a general decrease in hindgut microbial community similarity with distance. However, the population in the newly expanded range had similar hindgut microbial communities to one population in the historical range and levels of short chain fatty acids, an indicator of microbial fermentation activity, were similar among tropical and temperate locations. These data suggest that flexibility in the hindgut microbiome may play a role in enabling range-shifting herbivores to colonise new habitats.",Fish gut metagenome Targeted loci environmental,HARVESTED,2019-11-07T16:52:14,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003166/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003166/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003166/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Fish:Digestive system', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Fish:Digestive%20system'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003166/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003166/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003166/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003166,4.1,root:Host-associated:Fish:Digestive system

In the presence of added nitrate however, Methylobacter species were the dominant MOB. Pure culture studies of Methylomonas and Methylobacter isolated from the same environment and incubated in the same way confirmed that the growth of a Methylomonas strain was not significantly affected when N2 was the only provided nitrogen source, while growth of a Methylobacter strain was negatively impacted. By further exposing long-term methane fed microbial communities to different nitrogen sources, intraspecific dynamics of non-methanotrophic community members were observed, suggesting nitrate as an additional selective factor for co-occurring species.

1049,studies,MGYS00004364,PRJNA251746,MGYS00004364,6.0,SRP043012,Marine Biological Laboratory,True,,"Approximately 42% of the continental crust is composed of mafic magmatic rocks, such as basalts. These rocks often manifest themselves as massive areas known as large igneous provinces (LIPs). LIPs cover thousands to millions of square kilometers and thus comprise major portions of the subsurface and the biosphere. LIPs, and more specifically basalts, are known to be chemically reactive and favorable for microbial life due to the abundance of reduced compounds in the rock.  LIPs exist both in marine systems and terrestrial systems. In marine systems, microorganisms are known to extensively interact with minerals in basalt and may play a large role in the global biogeochemical cycles of C, Fe, and S. Sources of energy available to lithoautotrophic microorganisms below the seafloor include minerals containing reduced Fe and S and also H2 generated from water-rock reactions. Hydrogen is of particular interest in terrestrial subsurface basalt systems, where the subsurface lithoautotrophic microbial ecosystem (SLiME) hypothesis originated. SLiMEs are microbial communities that subsist in deep oligotrophic environments without utilizing energy rich reduced organic compounds that originated from photosynthesis. SLiMEs were first hypothesized to exist in the Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG). Basalt systems also host diverse communities apart from SLiMEs, such as microbial communities consisting of iron reducers, sulfate reducers, acetogens, and methanogens. In the basaltic Snake River Plain Aquifer (SRPA) in Idaho, microbial communities cycle carbon by forming and oxidizing methane.  Today, LIPs are being examined as potential geological storage sites for carbon dioxide in an attempt to sequester CO2 away from the atmosphere to alleviate temperature increases due to climate changes. The Wallula pilot well being used for a geologic carbon sequestration project in eastern Washington State and located in the CRBG provides a window to the subsurface where the microbial diversity of these geologically important regions can be explored. In addition, the well will provide insight into the microbial communities present in the basalts that could play a role in carbon cycling in the deep subsurface where supercritical CO2 (scCO2) is injected.  Analyzing samples from the CRBG using deep DNA sequencing technology will further the understanding of the unique microbial diversity of the subsurface, especially with respect to community composition of LIPS and different members contained in different formations. Pyrosequencing will also establish an important baseline for understanding the microbial communities in the aquifers of the Wallula pilot well prior to the injection of scCO2. These communities will certainly change following the injection and pyrosequencing could play a critical role in the analysis of the samples obtained after the injection of scCO2 into the system. The high resolution associated with deep sequencing technology would allow the detection of shifts in the diversity of the microbial communities.  All samples presented here originated from the Wallula pilot well in eastern Washington State. The well penetrates through three Columbia River Basalt formations, the deepest of which is targeted for carbon sequestration. This study aimed to characterize the microbial community prior to the injection of carbon dioxide to provide a baseline for comparison after carbon has been stored in the basalt. Samples Wal213, Wal220, Wal31, Wal39, and Wal413 were collected from pristine formations as the well was drilled using a progressive drill-and-test technique that provides samples more representative of the formation of origin. Quality of the samples was also ensured due to the use of an underbalanced drilling technique in which water from the formation acted as drilling fluid, as well as the collection of samples after extensive pumping of the well. Sample Wal34 was collected 2 years after the completion of the well. The microbial diversity of other locations in the Colombia River Basalt Group has been investigated previously (Stevens et al., 1993; Stevens and McKinley, 1995; Fry et al., 1997), but not at the location of the Wallula pilot well and not using sequencing technology which provides a more complete picture of the microbial community. A more detailed description of the Wallula pilot well can be found in the 2009 report Preliminary Hydrogeologic Characterization Results from the Wallula Pilot Study by McGrail et al.

All three cores record dramatic changes in oceanographic/limnic conditions resulting from oscillation between oligotrophic and euxinic condition, yet they also differ remarkably between sites. Our motivation for this study is based on the premise that paleoenvironmental conditions in the overlying water column are intimately linked to the composition of aquatic microbial communities and thus the inoculum for subseafloor communities. Our study will address the long-standing question to what degree the composition of subseafloor microbial communities is linked to paleoenvironmental conditions at time of deposition. The sample set at both Mediterranean sites is composed of carbonate-rich, organic-lean sediments and interspersed so-called sapropels, that is, organic-rich black layers that were deposited during climates that were probably warmer and more humid than today, when the Mediterranean was euxinic. The samples from the discovery basin are influenced by a highly saline brine and thus may select for halophilic sedimentary microbes. The Black Sea sample set is composed of organic-lean coccolith ooze deposited during the recent few thousand years, an organic-rich sapropel deposited during the early Holocene and below of sediment deposited during the late glacial/early Holocene when the Black Sea was still a freshwater lake. We examine both archaeal and bacterial diversity with a 454-based tag sequencing survey. We can address questions relating to the paleoenvironmental history at each site as well as to the relationship of microbial communities in sediments deposited during euxinic conditions at three sites along a salinity gradient remote to each other, in two different ocean basins. The sample set will be accompanied by an in-depth biogeochemical characterization of its sedimentary habitat.

The mud-volcanism transports deep-sourced fluids and hydrocarbons to the seafloor3, which upward supply often supports chemosynthetic benthic life and microbial communities that play significant ecological roles in biogeochemical carbon cycle4,5. Yet, geochemical and microbiological characteristics of the deep mud-volcano subsurface remain largely unknown. Here, we studied an active submarine mud-volcano in the Nankai Trough by drilling down to 200 meters from the summit. Cell count and molecular analyses indicate that relatively small (102~105 cells/cm3) but phylogenetically diverse microbial populations are present throughout the cored sediment. In the pore water, carbon isotopic compositions of bicarbonate and acetate are notably 13C-enriched up to the maximum value of +40 and -25, respectively. High concentrations of hydrogen (up to 1,800 nM) are observed, suggesting a thermodynamically feasible condition for microbial acetogenesis via CO2 reduction. Radiotracer experiments consistently showed that acetogenesis activities are generally 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than those of methanogenesis. These data indicate that the deep biosphere in the submarine mud-volcano is characterized by tectonic and sedimentolgoical regimes of the oceanic accretionary wedge, and hence different from the stratified sedimentary biosphere.",Deep mud-volcano biosphere in the Nankai accretionary wedge,HARVESTED,2019-11-07T16:33:44,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002887/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002887/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002887/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Sediment', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Sediment'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002887/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002887/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002887/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002887,4.1,root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Sediment

The emission of CO2 may critically impact the geochemical, geophysical and ecological characteristics of the deep-sea sedimentary environment. So far it remains unclear whether microbial communities that have been detected in such high-CO2 and low-pH habitats are metabolically active, and if so, what the biogeochemical and ecological consequences for the environment are. In this study, RNA-based molecular approaches and radioactive tracer-based respiration rate assays were combined to study the density, diversity and metabolic activity of microbial communities in CO2-seep sediment at the Yonaguni Knoll IV hydrothermal field of the southern Okinawa Trough. In general, the number of microbes decreased sharply with increasing sediment depth and CO2 concentration. Phylogenetic analyses of community structure using reverse-transcribed 16S ribosomal RNA showed that the active microbial community became less diverse with increasing sediment depth and CO2 concentration, indicating that microbial activity and community structure are sensitive to CO2 venting. Analyses of RNA-based pyrosequences and catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization data revealed that members of the SEEP-SRB2 group within the Deltaproteobacteria and anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME-2a and -2c) were confined to the top seafloor, and active archaea were not detected in deeper sediments (1330?cm in depth) characterized by high CO2. Measurement of the potential sulfate reduction rate at pH conditions of 39 with and without methane in the headspace indicated that acidophilic sulfate reduction possibly occurs in the presence of methane, even at very low pH of 3. These results suggest that some members of the anaerobic methanotrophs and sulfate reducers can adapt to the CO2-seep sedimentary environment; however, CO2 and pH in the deep-sea sediment were found to severely impact the activity and structure of the microbial community.",Metabolically active microbial communities in marine sediment under high-CO2 and low-pH extremes,HARVESTED,2019-11-07T16:33:14,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002474/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002474/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002474/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Sediment', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Sediment'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002474/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002474/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002474/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002474,4.1,root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Sediment

Furthermore, the few studies thus far conducted in deep oceanic crust reveal an active microbial community in this habitat. Yet, the extent to which microbial communities in bottom sediments and underlying crustal habitats interact is unclear. Are microbial communities in sediments seeded from basement communities, or vice versa? If there is influence from one habitat type on the other, how far does this influence extend, both with vertical distance away from the interface and laterally along the flow path of fluids within basement? We propose to conduct tag pyrosequencing on samples from a spectrum of sediment-basement habitats to identify patterns in microbial community shifts across sediment-basement interfaces. Such comparisons will allow us to evaluate whether microbial groups from one habitat are found in another, and to examine whether members of the ''rare biosphere'' in one habitat come to dominate in another.

If microbial life in the igneous ocean crust extends to the depth of the ~120C isotherm (the current upper temperature limit of life) then the volume of rock available for microbial colonization is about the same as the volume of the oceans. Most of this volume is difficult to sample but microorganisms have been identified from deep layers of the igneous ocean crust.  Additional understanding of the deep igneous biome comes from microorganisms extracted from subsurface fluids; although unattached microorganisms in aquifer fluids are not necessarily representative of the microorganisms attached to the host rocks. Another difficulty is that the ocean crust is mineralogically heterogeneous typically on the 0.01 mm to 10 mm scale and if the mineralogy influences or controls the microbial communities, then the ocean crust is microbially heterogeneous on the 0.01 to 10 mm scale. Community structure that is determined from bulk crustal rock samples will not be informative about how communities are associated with crustal minerals. Also, molecular and sample processing methods are not currently available to determine the community structure of minerals in igneous rocks.  In situ colonization of mono-mineralic substrates in the ocean crust is one method of determining microbial community structure of the minerals that make up the crust. We devised a method of incubating a wide variety of mono-mineral aggregates in the ocean floor simultaneously so that they all experienced the same temperature, water composition, and pressure.

The wealth of rare metals concentrated in these nodules has spurred global interest in exploring the mining potential of these resources. The prevailing theory of abiotic formation has been called into question and the role of microbial metabolisms in nodule development is now an area of active research. To understand the community structure of microbes associated with nodules and their surrounding sediment, we performed targeted sequencing of the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene from three nodules collected from the central South Pacific. Results have shown that the microbial communities of the nodules are significantly distinct from the communities in the surrounding sediments, and that the interiors of the nodules harbor communities different from the exterior. This suggests not only differences in potential metabolisms between the nodule and sediment communities, but also differences in the dominant metabolisms of interior and exterior communities.",Microbial communities associated with ferromanganese nodules and the surrounding sediments,HARVESTED,2019-11-07T16:31:47,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002488/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002488/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002488/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Oceanic:Abyssal plane', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Oceanic:Abyssal%20plane'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002488/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002488/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002488/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002488,4.1,root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Oceanic:Abyssal plane

Here we provide evidence supporting connection between the presence of surfactant-associated bacteria in the near-surface layer of the ocean, slicks on the sea surface, and a distinctive feature in the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery of the sea surface. From DNA analyses of the in situ samples using pyrosequencing technology, we found the highest abundance of surfactant-associated bacterial taxa in the near surface layer below the slick. Our study suggests that production of surfactants by marine bacteria takes place in the organic-rich areas of the water column. Produced surfactants can then be transported to the sea surface and form slicks when certain physical conditions are met. This finding has potential applications in monitoring organic materials in the water column using remote sensing techniques. Identifying a connection between marine bacteria and production of natural surfactants may provide a better understanding of the global picture of biophysical processes at the boundary between the ocean and atmosphere, air-sea exchange of greenhouse gases, and production of climate-active marine aerosols.",Surfactant-associated bacteria in the near-surface layer of the ocean,HARVESTED,2019-11-07T16:31:18,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004064/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004064/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004064/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Oceanic', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Oceanic'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004064/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004064/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004064/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004064,4.1,root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Oceanic

In this work, we use DNA metabarcoding of 18S rRNA gene and particle interceptor traps (PITs) to characterize the taxonomic composition of particles sinking out of the photic layer in the California Current Ecosystem. The PITs included formalin-fixed and 'live' traps to investigate compositional changes associated with consumption and remineralization processes. Sequences affiliated to Radiolaria, mainly Spumellaria and Acantharia, dominated the eukaryotic assemblage in fixed-traps (90%) with Dinophyta and Metazoa making minor contributions. The prominence of Radiolaria decreased markedly in live-traps (<3%), possibly due to selective consumption by large copepods, heterotrophic nanoflagellates and amoeboid phaeodarians that were heavily enriched in these traps. These patterns were consistent across the coastal-to-open water masses surveyed, despite major differences in productivity and trophic structure of the epipelagic plankton community.

Our data demonstrated the dipole had a substantial influence on the microbial distributions and community structures both vertically and horizontally. Large Alpha- and Beta- diversity differences were observed between anticyclonic eddy and cyclonic eddy in surface and subsurface layers, consistent with distribution changes of major OTUs in the dipole with effects of uplifted, downward transported, enriched, depleted, horizontally transported.

However, labile nucleic acids are generally considered to be microbially degraded in water and sediment columns. Previously, ancient eukaryotic DNA has been retrieved from sediments associated with anoxic water column in lake and semi-closed sea, due to the minimized effect of oxic biodegradation. Cold seep sediment is characterized by high upward flux of methane, where there is the possibility that the excess energy source might suppress the degradation of deposited organic matter including nucleic acids by microbial activity. We investigated the preservation of ancient eukaryotic DNA in marine sediments associated with and without methane hydrate in the eastern Japan Sea, between which the dominant prokaryotic populations are clearly distinct. Marine sediments were retrieved from the eastern Japan Sea during a cruise onboard R/V Marion Dufresne in June 2010. Two-step alkaline DNA extractions were conducted with 0.1 g of marine sediments. DNA from living organisms such as fungi was removed by the first extraction under mildly heated conditions at 65 degrees Celsius, which was followed by the second extraction at 95 degrees Celsius. Triplicate DNA extraction and subsequent clone library analysis were more reproducible for marine sediments associated with methane hydrate. Based on highly variable18S rRNA gene sequences, terrestrial and marine organisms were taxonomically identified at the species level. The diversity of ancient eukaryotic DNA represented by Alveolata, Fungi, Stramenopiles and Viridiplantae was comparable between this study and previous ones. As only 0.1g of g wet sediment is required, the overall methodology developed in this study has great potential to reconstruct terrestrial and marine ecology at high time resolution. In addition, methane hydrate-associated sediments, which are globally distributed along the continental margin, have great potential to reconstruct the past terrestrial and marine ecology around the world over geological timescales.",Preservation of ancient eukaryotic DNA in methane hydrate-associated marine sediments.,HARVESTED,2019-11-07T16:28:36,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003130/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003130/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003130/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Cold seeps:Sediment', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Cold%20seeps:Sediment'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003130/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003130/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003130/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003130,4.1,root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Cold seeps:Sediment

Routine monitoring is usually required by regulation, and has traditionally been based on benthic macrofaunal communities. This is reliant on taxonomic expertise, excludes analsyis of micro-organisms and turn-around times can be slow, limiting opportunities for adaptive management. Environmental metabarcoding is a powerful high-throughput sequencing-based technique that is promising for identifying and quantifying assemblages of benthic organisms for biomonitoring. Previous studies have demonstrated relationships between specific taxonomic groups (e.g., bacteria, foraminifera or other eukaryotes) and anthropogenic effects. However, there is uncertainty around applicability at larger spatial and temporal scales, and the absence of fixed categorical scales makes the use of data challenging for routine biomonitoring. In this study, we analysed 105 sediment samples collected over three years from three salmon farms spanning two separate bioregions. Environmental DNA and RNA (eDNA/eRNA) metabarcoding of three taxonomic groups (foraminifera [For], bacteria [Bac], and general eukaryotes [Euk]) was undertaken in parallel with traditional macrofaunal and biochemical analysis (which were used to calculate an Enrichment Stage [ES] index for each sample). The most abundant 200 to 250 Operational Taxonomic Units in each taxonomic group were assigned to Eco-Groups (EG) using a quantitative, quality-based method. These were then used to develop a Metabarcoding Biotic Index (MBI) for each group individually (For-MBI, Bac-MBI, and Euk-MBI) and in combination (multi-trophic MBI; mt-MBI). Based on our assessment criteria we robustly allocated ca. 500 EG to a wide range of known and unknown taxa. Using both the development (year 1 [Y1] and 2 [Y2]) and independent validation (year 3) datasets the weakest correlation was between For-MBI and ES (eDNA/RNA, R2 = 0.731 to 0.850), whereas strong correlations were obtained between the mt-MBI and, or when just Bac and Euk data (mt[Bac+Euk]-MBI) were combined (eDNA/RNA, R2 > 0.900). Consequently, we suggest that foraminifera be excluded from the mt-MBI, which will reduce analytical time and costs. The strong correlations obtained between the mt-MBI and ES confirms that it has the potential to complement or even replace current fish farm biomonitoring techniques in the near future.",Development and validation of a multi-trophic metabarcoding biotic index for benthic organic enrichment biomonitoring using a salmon farm case-study.,HARVESTED,2019-11-07T16:27:33,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002724/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002724/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002724/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Coastal:Sediment', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Coastal:Sediment'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002724/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002724/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002724/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002724,4.1,root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Coastal:Sediment

Mt. Hope Bay, Massachusetts is an ideal site to base a study of human pathogen presence and distribution because it has several important sources of human impact, including sewage disposal sites and the thermal outfall of a power plant within a mile of each other. The Bay has undergone limited monitoring for several different parameters, including fish populations, river runoff, meteorological forcing, tidal cycles and water chemistry as part of the Mt. Hope Bay Natural Laboratory (MHBNL) program, a 5-year interdisciplinary project at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth School of Marine Science and Technology (SMAST). While phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in the water column have been fairly well monitored, although not at a molecular level, microbial communities remain relatively uncharacterized. This project presents comprehensive (eukaryal, bacterial, archaeal) data from small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene clone libraries and next-generation Illumina amplicon sequencing for samples collected near the thermal plume and underlying sediments of the Brayton Point Power Plant. Not surprising, our findings reveal a highly diverse consortium of the three domains including relatives of sludge bacteria, polyaromatic hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, and representatives related to the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Clostridium. It is clear that even limited knowledge about the overall microbial community composition can lead to important observations about the ecosystem as a whole.

These waters flow over adjacent coral reefs, which help compose the Florida reef tract, and also close to recreational beaches. In partnership with the NOAA FACE program to survey water quality, 38 total nearshore seawater samples were collected and characterized for bacterial populations from 6 distinct coastal locales - the Port Everglades and Hillsboro Inlets, Hollywood and Broward wastewater outfalls, and associated reef waters over the course of one year. More than 227,000 quality checked 16S rRNA V4 amplicon sequences were generated for longitudinal taxonomic profiles of marine bacteria and archaea. From these sequences, 4447 unique OTUs were found and there was a mean OTU count of 5986.816 across all site. Sequences were found to vary significantly due to seasonal effects and by site, but depth showed no significant correlation. Abundant microbial taxa across all samples included Synechococcus, Pelagibacteraceae, Bacteroidetes, and various Proteobacteria. Inlet-based communities significantly differed from outfall and reef communities, with a relative increase in Rhodobacteraceae and Cryomorphaceae, and depletion of SAR406 sequences. Unifrac analysis confirmed significant differences in the inlet populations relative to reef and outfall microbial communities. However, based on alpha diversity measurements, the outfalls sites showed the most diversity with the occurrence of Thiotrichales, Alteromonadales, and the archaean Thermoplasmata.

Although the number of registered sequences in V4-V5 regions was remarkably higher than other regions, the identification power in NGS-based environmental surveys was lowest in V4-V5 regions due to the lowest sequence variability. The number of registered sequences in V1-V3 region was ca. two times smaller than V7-V9 region, and the sequence variability in V1-V3 region was significantly higher than that in V7-V9 region. Then, the identification power was not significant between these two regions, implying identification power is affected by combination of numbers of registered sequences and the sequence variability.

Here, we propose a new metagenetic approach for revealing the community structure of marine planktonic copepods using 454 pyrosequencing of nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA. We developed a method for clustering pyrosequencing data into molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) through analysis of an artificial copepod community containing 33 morphologically identified species. The 99% similarity threshold had high species-level resolution for MOTU clustering but overestimated species richness. The artificial community was appropriately clustered into MOTUs at 97% similarity, with little inflation in MOTU numbers and with relatively high species-level resolution. The number of sequence reads per MOTU was correlated with dry weight of that taxon, suggesting that sequence reads could be used as a proxy for biomass. Next, we applied the method to field-collected samples, and the results corresponded reasonably well with morphological analysis of these communities. Numbers of MOTUs were well correlated with species richness at 97% similarity, and large numbers of sequence reads were generally observed in MOTUs derived from species with large biomass. MOTUs were successfully classified at the family level at 97% similarity; similar patterns of species richness and biomass within families were revealed with metagenetic and morphological analyses. At the 99% similarity threshold, MOTUs with high proportions of sequence reads were identified as biomass-dominant species in each field-collected sample.

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing we identified two new clades of Synechococcus, EPC1 and EPC2, and delineated an interannual pattern in a dynamic transition zone where upwelled and eastern boundary current waters mix. In years when more oligotrophic water intrudes further inshore Prochlorococcus HLI and LLI are more abundant, while under stronger upwelling Synechococcus I and IV dominate. However, contributions of some cyanobacterial clades are proportionally relatively constant, e.g., Synechococcus EPC2. In addition to supporting observations that Prochlorococcus LLI thrive at higher irradiances than other LL taxa, the results suggest LLI tolerate lower temperatures than reported. The phylogenetic precision of our analytical approach and depth of barcoded pyrosequencing also allowed us to detect clades at low abundance in unexpected places. For example, Prochlorococcus at the coast, and sequences related to freshwater Cyanobium spp. in the open ocean, although it remains unclear whether these come from resident or advected cells.

Bacterial activity is generally low in cold polar waters compared to lower latitudes. This view appears to be changing, with new studies of microbial foodwebs in Arctic and Antarctic oceans. We characterized bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic community diversity and composition from two depths (near surface and below the euphotic zone) at four sites, including the inshore and offshore, and north and south corners of a sampling grid along the western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). We detected up to 2-fold higher richness in microbial eukaryotes at surface and deep inshore northern stations as compared to southern ones but offshore northern and southern stations revealed either no trend or higher richness at depth in the south. In contrast, bacterial and archaeal richness showed no significant differences either inshore or offshore at northern versus southern extents but did vary with depth. Archaea were virtually absent in summer surface waters but were present in summer deep and winter surface samples. Overall, winter bacterial and archaeal assemblages most closely resembled summer sub-euphotic zone assemblages, reflecting well-established seasonal patterns of water column turnover and stratification that result in an isolated layer of winter water below the euphotic zone. Inter-domain heterotroph-phototroph interactions were evident from network analysis. The WAP is among the most rapidly warming regions on earth.

Oceanographers have attempted to discern whether these distribution patterns are shared with marine biota, and a lively debate has emerged with regard to the global distribution of microbes. Limitations in sampling resolution for such large-scale assessments have often prohibited definitive conclusions. This investigation has evaluated microbial planktonic communities along a ~15,400 km Pacific Ocean transect with DNA from samples aquired every 2 degrees of latitude within a three month period between late August to early November, 2003. Next generation sequencing targeted Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya rDNA sequences.Beta analysis of ~10.8 million high quality sequences showed significant geographic patterns of microbial communities, primarily the Bacteria and Archaea domains. Despite regional clustering, none of the domains exhibited a unimodal pattern of alpha-diversity with respect to latitude. Bacteria communities increased in richness from Arctic to Antarctic waters; whereas Archaea and Eukarya communities showed no latitudinal or polar trends.

It is unclear how the taxonomic composition of biomass on a filter changes as a function of filtered water volume, potentially due to filter clogging. Using seawater from a marine oxygen minimum zone, we conducted experiments to quantify the 16S rRNA gene composition of biomass on a prefilter (GF/A, 1.6 um pore size) and a downstream collection filter (Sterivex, 0.2 um) over a range of typical collection volumes, from 50 to 5000 ml. Significant community shifts occurred in both filter fractions, and were most dramatic in the prefilter community. Sequences affiliated with Vibrionales decreased from ~40-60% of the prefilter datasets at low volumes (50-500 ml) to less than 5% at higher volumes, while groups such at the Chromatiales and Thiohalorhabdales followed opposite trends, increasing from minor representation to become the dominant taxa at higher volumes. Taxa shown previously to be associated with marine particles, including diverse members of the Deltaproteobacteria, Planctomycetes and Bacteroidetes, were among those showing the greatest increase with filter volume (4 to 27-fold). Metrics of taxon richness (97% sequence clusters) also varied significantly with volume, and in opposing directions depending on filter fraction, highlighting potential biases in community complexity estimates.

The Deepwater Horizon, an ultra-deep, offshore drilling platform, began working GoM oil fields in 2001. While working a well in Mississippi Canyon on April 20, 2010, a bolus of methane gas ascended the drill pipe and exploded at the surface. Two days later the platform sank and since then, substantial quantities of oil and gas have leaked from the damaged wellhead. This work addressed the offshore oceanic impacts of the BP spill.  Sediment microbial mediated processes are capable of oxidizing oil and methane in the environment. The PI''s examined the impacts of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill on microbially mediated processes in the deep waters and sediments in the vicinity of the spill site. The work complemented several funded or planned geochemical and microbiological sampling programs focused on the oil spill response. PI''s evaluated rates of water column methane oxidation and sediment sulfate reduction and methanogenesis at multiple sites around the spill site. Additional experiments quantified the impact of nutrients, oxygen and substrate concentrations on these important microbially mediated processes.  The Joye group participated in six research cruises during 2010 and received samples from another six cruises from the study area. On all cruises, water samples were collected using a CTD rosette and Niskin or Go-Flo bottles. Sediment samples were obtained by box coring, multi-coring, or using the manned submersible ALVIN.  The PI''s extended the monitoring/assessment program that was initiated through the NOAA National Institute of Undersea Science and Technology (NIUST) funded cruise and further leveraged by NOAA/NIUST (cruises in July 2010, October 2010) by conducting three major expeditions in 2010.

Oil spill effects on nitrogen cycling caused by either changes in species composition of primary producers or microbial community composition have also been documented. Although low to moderate oiling of coastal wetlands has been shown to impact ecosystem functions, studies focused on determining long term impacts of oil spills on marsh vegetation, microbial community composition and associated effects on nitrogen cycling are relatively limited. This project investigated temporal effects of plant diversity on denitrification and microbial community dynamics through mesocosm experiments. The mesocosms consisted of the black mangrove, Avicennia germinans, along with either a monoculture or polyculture of the smooth cord grass, Spartina alterniflora.

We characterized the microbial community composition and diversity in sediments sampled along two rivers consistently polluted by e-waste, and examined how community functions respond to the complex combined pollution. High throughput 16S rRNA sequencing showed that Proteobacteria (particularly Deltaproteobacteria) dominated the sediment microbial assemblages followed by Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Firmicutes. PICRUSt metagenome inference provided an initial insight into the metabolic potentials of these e-waste affected communities, with genes encoding key enzymes (including dioxygenase, dehydrogenase, aldolase, decarboxylase, hydroxylase and hydrolase) in organic pollutants-degradation pathways largely harbored by some of the dominant genera (such as Sulfuricurvum, Thiobacillus and Burkholderia) detected in situ. Statistical analyses revealed that toxic organic compounds contributed more to the observed variations in sediment microbial community structure and function (24.68% and 8.89%, respectively) than heavy metals (12.18% and 4.68%), and BaP, available lead and EC were the key contributors.

Changes in rates of biological processes are often associated with changes in diversity, yet there is little knowledge of the diversity of active microbes on glacier surfaces and its controls. We examined the microbial abundance, community structure, and the proportion of the active microbes at two contrasting surface sites located at the margin and in the interior of the Greenland ice sheet over the course of a melting season, using DNA and RNA co-extraction from the same samples, quantitative PCR and pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA and rDNA. Whereas the rDNA abundances were similar at both sites (108  109 copies g-1), the rRNA abundance was significantly higher in the interior (1010 copies g-1). Significant differences in diversity were found between the sites, with the DNA diversity significantly higher at the margin and the RNA diversity higher at the interior site. The bulk of the active communities at both sites comprised Cyanobacteria and Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria, suggesting a truncated food web structure dominated by few bacterial primary producers and decomposers. We suggest that the ice sheet margin contains a more diverse but less active assemblage of microbes while the interior harbours a less diverse but well-adapted active community.

Here we investigate the microbial community on the surface of Aldegondabreen, a valley glacier in Svalbard which is supplied with carbon and nutrients from different sources across its surface, including colonies of seabirds. We used a combination of geochemical analysis (surface debris, ice and meltwater), quantitative PCR (targeting the 16S rRNA and amoA genes), pyrosequencing and multivariate statistical analysis to better understand the ecology of prokaryotic microbes on the surface on Aldegondabreen and their role in nitrogen cycling. The combination of high nutrient input, supraglacial melt water flow and the presence of fine, claylike particles supports the formation of cmscale cryoconite aggregates in some areas of the glacier surface. We show that a diverse microbial community is present, dominated by the cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria, that are wellknown in supraglacial environments. Allochthonous material including plant tissuederived chloroplasts was also identified in the molecular analysis.

The studies of microbial communities in glacial lakes, especially in southeast Europe are rare and even neglected.

Historical surveys utilizing microscopy or culture-dependent methods suggest that marine fungi are relatively species-poor, predominantly Dikarya, and localized to coastal habitats. However, the use of high-throughput sequencing technologies to characterize microbial communities has challenged traditional concepts of fungal diversity by revealing novel phylotypes from both terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Here, I used ion semiconductor sequencing (Ion Torrent) of the ribosomal large subunit (LSU/28S) to explore fungal diversity from water and sediment samples collected from four habitats in coastal North Carolina. The dominant taxa observed were Ascomycota and Chytridiomycota, though all fungal phyla were represented. Diversity was highest in sand flats and wetland sediments, though benthic sediments harbored the highest proportion of novel sequences. Most sequences assigned to early-diverging fungal groups could not be assigned beyond phylum with statistical support, suggesting they belong to unknown lineages.","Fungal communities across four coastal marine habitats in North Carolina, USA",HARVESTED,2019-11-07T16:15:32,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004696/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004696/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004696/downloads,2,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Coastal', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Coastal'}}, {'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Wetlands:Sediment', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Wetlands:Sediment'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004696/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004696/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004696/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004696,4.1,root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Coastal|root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Wetlands:Sediment

Roche 454 amplicon data generated by the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF) V1-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Analysis and FISH probes designed against several of these amplicon sequences indicated that these two morphotypes were members of the phylum Chloroflexi. Subsequent surveys of full-scale plant biomass samples showed these two filaments were common in these systems. However, considerable further diversity appears to exist and therefore should be a subject of further research.",Identification of filamentous Chloroflexi morphotypes in Activated sludge plants,HARVESTED,2019-11-07T16:14:53,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003490/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003490/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003490/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Engineered:Wastewater:Activated Sludge', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Engineered:Wastewater:Activated%20Sludge'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003490/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003490/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003490/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003490,4.1,root:Engineered:Wastewater:Activated Sludge

We used qPCR and 16S rRNA gene tag libraries to measure relative growth rates of a microbial community from Cape Lookout Bight, NC, in a laboratory mesocosm. Homogenized sediments were incubated for 122 days, hydrogen concentrations were consistent with thermodynamic control by sulfate-reducing prokaryotes during the sulfate-reducing phase and methanogenesis commenced when hydrogen increased above the methanogen thermodynamic maintenance. Uncultured clades of Methanosarcinales and Methanomicrobiales grew during the methanogenic phase with doubling times ranging from 15-46 days, considerably slower than those grown in pure cultures. An uncultured archaeal group, Kazan-3A-21, also increased with methane production. The majority of the population were from deeply-branching uncultured groups and, like the majority of the putative sulfate reducers, were mostly unresponsive to the shift from sulfate reduction to methanogenesis.

In the laboratory, these sediments were stored under anoxic conditions at 4 oC until slurry incubations were. Anoxic 50-mL slurry incubations were made in 120-ml serum vials with sediment from 416  441 and 441  466 cm depths and anoxic sulphate-free artificial sea water (ASW; composition [L-1]: 26.4 g NaCl, 11.2 g MgCl2.6H2O, 1.5 g CaCl2.2H2O and 0.7 g KCl) at a ratio of 1:3 (w/v) under a headspace of N2. Incubations (n=9) were supplemented by adding iron(III) oxides (hematite or magnetite; LanXess, Germany; 30 mol l-1) and glucose (2 mM) as electron donor. Control incubations (glucose only, n = 9) were supplemented with 2 mM glucose only. The potential for reduction of amended hematite (HG) or magnetite (MG) was evaluated by comparing the amount of Fe2+ formed in crystalline iron(III)-treated incubations to those of the glucose only control (G). Triplicates of each treatment set were incubated statically in the dark at 4 oC, 10 oC, or 30 oC. Supplementary incubations were set up at 30 oC, for testing the effect of 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES) on methanogenesis and iron reduction in the presence of crystalline iron oxides. For molecular analysis, one millilitre of slurry from individual incubations, at specific time points as stated in each sample description, was used for nucleic acid extraction following a modified protocol from Lueders et al (2004). A two-step PCR approach for Illumina amplicon sequencing described by Herbold et al (2015) was adopted for amplification of Bacteria and Archaea 16S rRNA genes.

This may affect intestinal immune development, interacting with the effects of enteral feeding and gut microbiota colonization just after birth. Using preterm pigs as model for preterm infants, we hypothesized that prenatal exposure to gram-negative endotoxin influences postnatal bacterial colonization and gut immune development. Pig fetuses were given intra-amniotic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 3 d before preterm delivery by cesarean section, and were compared with litter-mate controls (CON) at birth and after 5 d of formula feeding and spontaneous bacterial colonization. Amniotic fluid was collected for analysis of leukocyte counts and cytokines, and the distal small intestine was analyzed for endotoxin level, morphology and immune cell counts. Intestinal gene expression and microbiota were analyzed by transcriptomics and metagenomics, respectively. At birth, LPS-exposed pigs showed higher intestinal endotoxin, neutrophil/macrophage density and shorter villi. About 1.0% of intestinal genes were affected at birth and DMBT1, a regulator of mucosal immune defense, was identified as the hub gene in the co-expression network. Genes related to innate immune response (TLR2, LBP, CD14, C3, SFTPD), neutrophil chemotaxis (C5AR1, CSF3R, CCL5) and antigen processing (MHC II, CD4) were also affected and expression levels correlated with intestinal neutrophil/macrophage density and amniotic fluid cytokine levels. On day 5, LPS and CON pigs showed similar necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) lesions, endotoxin levels, morphology, immune cell counts, gene expressions and microbiota (except for difference in some low-abundant species). Our results show that CA markedly affects intestinal genes at preterm birth, including genes related to immune cell infiltration. However, a few days later, following the physiological adaptations to preterm birth, CA had limited effects on intestinal structure, function, gene expression, bacterial colonization and NEC sensitivity. We conclude that short-term, prenatal intra-amniotic inflammation is unlikely to exert marked effects on intestinal immune development in preterm neonates beyond the immediate neonatal period.",Postnatal gut immunity and microbiota development is minimally affected by prenatal inflammation in preterm pigs,SUBMITTED,2019-11-04T00:00:00,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005126/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005126/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005126/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Mammals:Digestive system', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Mammals:Digestive%20system'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005126/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005126/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005126/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005126,4.1,root:Host-associated:Mammals:Digestive system

Some changes are even found in anatomic locations remote from where these helminths reside and may persist after helminth clearance. However, studies in humans have produced varied conclusions and the impact appears to vary widely depending on the helminth species present. To demonstrate how molecular approaches to the human gut microbiome can provide insights into the complex interplay among disparate organisms, DNA was extracted from cryopreserved stools collected from residents of 5 rural Kenyan villages prior to, 3 weeks and 3 months following albendazole (ALB) therapy. Samples were analyzed by qPCR for the presence of 8 species of intestinal parasites, and by MiSeq 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Based on pre-treatment results, the presence of neither Ascaris lumbricoides (Al) nor Necator americanus (Na) infection significantly altered the overall diversity of the microbiota in comparison with age-matched controls. Following ALB therapy and clearance of soil-transmitted helminths (STH), there were significant increases in the proportion of the microbiota made up by Clostridiales (p=0.0002, average fold change 0.57), and reductions in the proportion made up by Enterobacteriales (p=0.0004, average fold change -0.58). There were additional changes in the microbiota that appear to be related to ALB administration, suggesting that these antimicrobial effects must be considered in any post-treatment setting. Nevertheless, the helminth-associated changes in Clostridiales and Enterobacteriales suggest that clearance of STH, and Na in particular, alters the gut microbiota.

Bioactive dietary components, such as inulin, have been extensively studied for their bioactive properties, particularly in modulating gut immune function and reducing inflammation. It is has been shown that colonization with gastrointestinal parasitic worms (helminths) may alleviate chronic inflammation through promotion of T-helper cell type (Th) 2 and T-regulatory immune responses and alterations in the gut microbiome. In this study, we investigated if dietary inulin could modulate mucosal immune function in pigs during colonization with the porcine whipworm, Trichuris suis. T. suis infection induced a typical Th2-biased immune response characterised by transcriptional changes in Th2- and barrier function-related genes, accompanied by intestinal remodelling through increased epithelial goblet and tuft cell proliferation. We observed that inulin also up-regulated Th2-related immune genes (IL13, IL5), and suppressed Th1-related pro-inflammatory genes (IFNG, IL1A, IL8) in the colon. Notably, inulin augmented the T. suis-induced responses with increased transcription of key Th2 and mucosal barrier genes (e.g. IL13, TFF3), and synergistically suppressed pro-inflammatory genes such as IFNG and CXCL9. 16S rRNA sequencing of proximal colon digesta samples revealed that inulin supplementation reduced the abundance of bacterial phyla linked to inflammation, such as Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, and simultaneously increased Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Interestingly, pigs treated with both inulin and T. suis displayed the highest Bacteroidetes: Firmicutes ratio and the lowest gut pH, suggesting an interaction of diet and helminth infection that stimulates the growth of beneficial bacterial species. Overall, our data demonstrate that T. suis infection and inulin co-operatively enhance anti-inflammatory immune responses, which is potentially mediated by changes in microbiota composition. Our results highlight the intricate interactions between diet, immune function and microbiota composition in a porcine helminth infection model. This porcine model should facilitate further investigations into the use of bioactive diets as immunomodulatory mediators against inflammatory conditions, and how diet and parasites may influence gut health.",Mucosal Barrier and Th2 Immune Responses are Enhanced by Dietary Inulin in Pigs Infected with Trichuris suis,SUBMITTED,2019-08-05T00:00:00,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005100/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005100/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005100/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Mammals:Digestive system', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Mammals:Digestive%20system'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005100/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005100/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005100/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005100,4.1,root:Host-associated:Mammals:Digestive system

2096,studies,MGYS00004728,,MGYS00004728,369.0,SRP057027,UPENNBL,True,,"Dysbiosis in the human intestines, an alteration in the normal composition of the microbiota, characterizes a wide spectrum of diseases, such as infections, irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease. Dysbiosis has been studied extensively but typically characterized cross-sectionally and as alterations in bacterial taxonomic proportions.  The longitudinal contributions of diet, antibiotic use, and inflammation on the evolution of dysbiosis during therapy for Crohn's disease have not been well characterized. Here we used shot-gun metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples collected from a longitudinal prospective cohort of pediatric Crohn's disease subjects to analyze the representation and gene content of all types of organisms present, including bacteria, fungi, archaea and viruses.  Patients initiated treated with either antibodies directed against tumor necrosis factor alpha or enteral nutrition per the treating physician.  Multivariate analysis showed that microbiome composition was associated with three environmental stressors--intestinal inflammation, antibiotic use, and diet.  Bacterial gene signatures suggested that communities in Crohn's samples were responding to oxidative stress. Antibiotic use was associated with a more dysbiotic composition of the bacterial microbiota as well as a distinctive increase in fungal organisms and human DNA content. In contrast, the abundance of tailed phage and archaea was similar in feces of children with Crohn's disease and healthy controls.  Composition of the bacterial and fungal communities were highly correlated. Dysbiosis in bacterial and fungal communities was reduced in patients with reduction of intestinal inflammation by either therapy. Diet had an independent and rapid effect on gut microbiota composition within one week of initiation. Evidently dysbiosis characteristic of Crohn's disease results in part from inflammation and antibiotic use, and involves correlated changes in bacterial and eukaryotic community members.  Notably, the three stressors were independently associated with different bacteria and different gene pathways, reflecting concurrent disruption of normal homeostasis by multiple mechanisms. Thus, while dysbiosis in general is common to multiple disease states, the nature of the dysbiosis is unique to the environmental stressor.","Inflammation, Antibiotics, and Diet as Concurrent Environmental Stressors of the Gut Microbiome in Pediatric Crohn's Disease",HARVESTED,2019-05-14T09:59:32,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004728/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004728/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004728/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Fecal'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004728/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004728/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004728/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004728,4.1,root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal

However, evidence of probiotic gut mucosal colonization efficacy remains sparse and controversial. We metagenomically characterized the murine and human mucosal-associated gastrointestinal microbiome and found it to only partially correlate with stool microbiome. A sequential invasive multi-omics measurement at baseline and during consumption of an 11-strain probiotic combination or placebo, demonstrated that probiotics remain viable upon gastrointestinal passage. In colonized, but not germ-free mice, probiotics encountered a marked mucosal colonization resistance. In contrast, humans featured a person-, region- and microbial-specific mucosal colonization patterns, hallmarked by differential baseline host and microbiome features, but indistinguishable by probiotics presence in stool. Consequently, probiotics induced a transient, highly-individualized impact on mucosal community structure and gut transcriptome. Collectively, empiric probiotics supplementation may be limited in universally and persistently impacting the gut mucosa, meriting development of new personalized probiotic approaches.Abstract (2):Probiotics are widely prescribed for prevention of antibiotics-associated dysbiosis and related adverse effects. However, probiotic impact on post-antibiotic reconstitution of the gut mucosal host-microbiome niche remains elusive. We invasively examined the effects of multi-strain probiotics or autologous fecal microbiome transplantation (aFMT) on post-antibiotic reconstitution of the murine and human mucosal microbiome niche. Contrary to homeostasis, antibiotic perturbation enhanced probiotics colonization in the human mucosa, but only mildly improved colonization in mice.

The approach, however, frequently misses non-typical microbes and provides limited strain-level resolution. In the study, we applied an unbiased sequencing approach to lung sputum samples in order to gain a more complete picture of the lung microbiome. We explored changes in the lung microbiome composition over time, particularly during exacerbations and antibiotic treatments. Moreover, we distinguished between evolution of internal strains and introduction of external strains from the environment. To do this, we followed four CF patients displaying extreme clinical phenotypes over the course of two years. During each exacerbation or routine clinical visit, the lung sputum from these patients was taken for shotgun sequencing. Reads not mapping to the host were subjected to assembly, taxonomic profiling, strain typing, and variant analysis. Sequencing revealed the presence of several microbes missed by culture, particularly anaerobes. It allowed us to identify dominant strains of abundant microbes, and to correct mistakes in taxonomic assignment from culture.

Metagenomics studies have reported on the complexity of microbiomes associated with seagrass and can provide critical insights into the sustainable use and conservation of seagrasses. Recent conservation activities in Kenya focused mainly on coral reefs and mangrove forests with little direct action taken to conserve seagrass meadows. Pollution, over-exploitation of marine resources and minimal efforts towards enforcement of conservation laws of marine environments, have caused degradation and defoliation of seagrass habitats. Little is known about the microbes associated with seagrass species in Kenya and this study aimed to characterize the genetic diversity of the microbiomes of two prominent seagrass species, Enhalus acoroides and T. ciliatum, which is the most commonly occurring species.Methods. Replicate microbiome samples were collected from leaves, roots, sediment and water columns associated with two seagrass species from two sites on the Kenyan coast. The microbial communities of the samples were characterized and compared using 16S ribosomal RNA gene PCR and sequencing. Microbiome features including diversity and taxonomic composition were used to compare within and between sample types and sites.Results. Leaf samples from both E. acoroides and T. ciliatum had significantly different microbial communities comparted to root and sediment samples, revealing a diversity gradient with lowest diversity in water samples and highest in sediment. There were no significant variation in seagrass microbial composition associated with leaf and rhizosphere microbiomes of either E. acoroides or T. ciliatum. However, we did see a difference between water samples associated with each seagrass species.Discussion.This study of the microbial microbiomes associated with the sediments, roots, leaves and surrounding water of E. acoroides and T. ciliatum, included a limited number of samples from a small geographic area, providing a valuable first assessment of the microbial diversity of seagrass beds on the Kenyan coast. We found no significant differences between the plant-associated bacterial communities of the two-seagrass species investigated. Significant differences however, were observed amongst leaf-, root-, sediment- and water-associated bacterial communities. This work will contribute to understanding the dynamic environment of seagrass beds and will contribute to helping conserving and re-establishing seagrass beds degraded by due to anthropogenic activities.","Microbiome of two predominant seagrass species of the Kenyan coast, Enhalus acoroides and Thalassodendron ciliatum",SUBMITTED,2019-05-02T15:34:14,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004707/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004707/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004707/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Plants', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Plants'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004707/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004707/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004707/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004707,4.1,root:Host-associated:Plants

To determine the extent to which microbial assemblages are influenced by saltmarsh plant communities, as well as to examine patterns in microbial community structure at local and regional scales, we sampled sediments at three saltmarshes in Louisiana, USA.

Sediment samples were collected from the interior of several J. roemerianus stands as well as from the S. alterniflora matrix.

Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of rRNA gene fragments was used to determine regional patterns in bacterial, archaeal, and fungal assemblages, while Illumina sequencing was used to examine local, vegetation-driven, patterns in community structure at one site. Both enzyme activity and microbial community structure were primarily influenced by regional site. Within individual saltmarshes, bacterial and archaeal communities differed between J. roemerianus and S. alterniflora vegetated sediments, while fungal communities did not.

Pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA genes showed that Geobacter, Desulfuromonas, and Dehalococcoides populations grew significantly during the time PCE and TCE were converted to ethene. Most 16S rRNA sequences of Dehalococcoides spp. were phylogenetically close to known Dehalococcoides sp. strains, however about 10% of sequences were quite distant from the previously characterized Dehalococcoides sp.

Experimental mercury isotope tracer incubations confirmed that, while sulphate-reducers contribute to mercury methylation, methanogens and iron reducers are also quantitatively important for the process.

The present study was aimed at identifying novel genes involved in salt resistance from the microbial communities of brines and the rhizosphere of the halophyte Arthrocnemum from the Es Trenc saltern (Mallorca, Spain). The bacterial and archaeal diversity assessed by pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene libraries revealed the presence of microbial communities that are typical in such environments. Metagenomic libraries were constructed with DNA from brine and rhizosphere samples, they were transferred to the osmosensitive strain Escherichia coli MKH13, and screened for salt-resistant clones. As a result, a total of eleven genes that confer salt resistance were identified, some of which encode for well known proteins previously related to osmoadaptation as a glycerol and a proton pump, whereas other genes encode for proteins not previously related to this function as RNA and DNA helicases, an endonuclease III (Nth) and hypothetical proteins of unknown function. Furthermore, four of the retrieved genes were cloned and expressed in Bacillus subtilis and interestingly, three of them exhibited also salt resistance in this bacterium, broadening the spectrum of bacterial species where these genes can operate.

In this study, we experimentally tested the hypothesis that changes in sea ice dissolved organic matter (DOM) fractions affect the response of under-ice microbial communities and, as a corollary, the cycling of sea ice carbon in surface waters.Size-fractionated DOM fractions were isolated from first-year ice, producing three pools of dissolved organic carbon comprising the full DOM spectrum, large exopolymeric substances (EPS > 100 KDa molecular weight), and small EPS (< 100 KDa and > 10 KDa molecular weight). Enrichment experiments with these fractions revealed, over a 216 h period, significant and contrasting changes in prokaryotic abundance and production, substrate utilization rates, and microbial diversity between enrichments. The different DOM fractions differed in terms of molecular composition, elemental ratios and carbohydrate contribution, with the full DOM spectrum showing the highest proportion of carbohydrates and highest number of low-molecular weight unique compounds. Despite an abundance of low-molecular weight compounds in the DOM enrichment, the EPS fractions induced the strongest and fastest response of underice microbial communities, with highest growth rates and substrate utilization for the small EPS fraction. Shifts in microbial diversity were also observed over the course of the experiment, resulting in different community composition between enrichments. Notably, the EPS and DOM enrichments led to a dominance of Colwellia and Psychromonas, respectively.The results support our hypothesis, showing the fundamental role of the composition of the sea ice dissolved organic matter (DOM) pool and its dual impact, through changes in microbial diversity and substrate utilization, on organic matter cycling at the sea-ice interface.

In this study, a newly developed method – barcoded 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing – was employed to provide a detailed characterization of the bacterial communities in intertidal and subtidal marine biofilms developed in two seasons. This method has high sensitivity to detect low-abundance taxa and is able to generate a large amount of highly reliable data in a very short period of time. Our results revealed highly diverse biofilm bacterial communities varied with season and tidal level. Over 6,000 OTUs with species estimates of up to 15,000 were recovered in a biofilm sample, which is by far the highest record in sub-tropical marine biofilms and is much greater than biofilms developed in certain natural habitats. Nineteen phyla were found in the biofilm samples, for which Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria were the most abundant phylum dominating the intertidal and subtidal biofilms, respectively. Apart from these two phyla, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Planctomycetes were found to be the major groups recovered in both intertidal and subtidal biofilms, yet their relative abundance varied among samples. Full-length 16S rRNA gene clone library was constructed for the 4 biofilm samples and showed similar results with pyrosequencing.

Using a tag pyrosequencing technology, this study was the first to deeply investigate the microbial communities associated with three Red Sea sponges, Hyrtios erectus, Stylissa carteri, and Xestospongia testudinaria. We revealed highly diverse sponge-associated bacterial communities with up to 1,000 microbial OTUs and an estimate of up to 2,000 species. Altogether 26 bacterial phyla were detected from the Red Sea sponges, 11 of which were absent from the surrounding seawater and 4 of which were recorded in sponges for the first time. Up to 100 OTUs with an estimate of up to 300 archaeal species were revealed from a single sponge species. This is by far the highest diversity ever recorded for sponges. A non-negligible proportion of unclassified reads in sponges may represent the presence of novel species. Our results demonstrated that the sponge-associated microbial communities remained highly consistent in the same sponge species from different locations although they varied to certain degrees among different sponge species. A significant proportion of the tag sequences from the sponges could be assigned into one of the sponge-specific clusters previously defined. In addition, the sponge-associated microbial communities were consistently diverged from those in the surrounding seawater.

To date knowledge about mixo- and heterotrophic microorganisms in hydrothermal systems is derived from pure cultures only. We set out to identify acetate-consuming microorganisms in diffuse fluids from two distinct hydrothermal systems using cultivation-independent approaches. For this purpose we combined a characterization of the microbial community in fluids with short-term incubations (8-12 h) using 13C-labeled acetate at low concentrations (10 or 30 µM). We followed cell growth and assimilation of 13C into single cells by nanoSIMS combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In 55°C fluids from the Menez Gwen system, Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a novel epsilonproteobacterial group related to Nautiliales accounted for nearly all acetate-assimilating cells. In contrast, in 4°C and 37°C fluids from the Manus Basin (Papua New Guinea) Gammaproteobacteria dominated the 13C-acetate-assimilating community, which was supported by 16S rRNA sequences related to Marinobacter and Alteromonas. We also detected yet unidentified, weakly acetate assimilating cells in 72°C fluids (Manus Basin) that were presumably related to Acinetobacter.

This study uses an environmental MFC containing multiple anodes, positioned in chambered anoxic seawater overlying marine sediments, to explore how varying the time an anode is connected and disconnected from a cathode influences cumulative charge, and finds that a switching interval of 15 seconds when duty cycling among the anodes results in the greatest normalized current density (amps per unit time connected). Further studies demonstrate the overall electrode reaction resistance increases with shorter disconnection times, and there is a minimum time below which current decreases significantly. Microbial diversity analyses reveal a substantial enrichment in sulfur-cycling microbes on the anodes compared to the sediment, though no measurable change in community composition among operational anodes. Based on these data, we posit that, in environmental MFCs, replenishment of depleted chemical species within the biofilm and surrounding diffusion layer is necessary for maximum charge transfer, and that proton flux is not limiting in highly buffered systems.

We examined microbial communities over time by using high-throughput sequencing of microbial DNA collected between 2003 and 2010 from the subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM) layer of the Beaufort Sea (Canadian Arctic). We found that overall this layer has freshened and concentrations of nitrate, the limiting nutrient for photosynthetic production in Arctic seas, have decreased. We compared microbial communities from before and after the record September 2007 sea ice minimum and detected significant differences in communities from all three domains of life. In particular, there were significant changes in species composition of Eukarya, with ciliates becoming more common and heterotrophic marine stramenopiles (MASTs) accounting for a smaller proportion of sequences retrieved after 2007. Within the Archaea, Marine Group I Thaumarchaeota, which earlier represented up to 60% of the Archaea sequences in this layer, have declined to <10%.

There is also major concern that global warming and other anthropogenic stressors may be responsible for the spread of pathogens, enhanced virulence and decreased resilience of hosts. This project focuses on macroalgae or seaweeds, the dominant habitat-forming organisms in temperate rocky reef communities worldwide. They are the trees of temperate coastal ecosystems. Anthropogenic stressors can have dramatic effects on the health and persistence of large macroalgae and are responsible for extensive losses of habitat-forming algae. Importantly, declines in habitat-forming macroalgae not only impact the algae themselves, but have major effects on the diversity and abundance of associated organisms. During this project, we aim to characterise microbial communities associated with the surfaces of dominant seaweed species on temperate Australian coasts, from northern New South Wales, south to Tasmania and also along the western Australian coastline. Furthermore, we aim to identify potential pathogens associated with stressed specimens and quantify their abundance at different sites and different times and correlate microbial data with various physico-chemical information from each site and specimen. This work will provide baseline data on algal-bacterial associations on a latitudinal scale and may also provide information on the distribution and abundance of potential algal pathogens.

Both ecological and evolutionary forces are thought to have shaped these communities. However, previous efforts to quantify the extent to which different factors contribute to the structure of gut bacterial communities have targeted either a range of host diversity too narrow to analyze ecological drivers of community structure, or so wide that diet and phylogeny are tightly correlated, and thus difficult to disentangle. In order to assess the relative contribution of host ecology (including dietary specializations) and evolution (phylogenetic relationships) in shaping gut microbiome diversity we have chosen to study the phyllostomid bats (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae). Phyllostomid bats span almost the entire dietary diversity known for terrestrial mammals, with omnivorous, insectivorous, carnivorous, hematophagous, nectarivorous, and frugivorous species. Crucially, there is a robust phylogenetic framework for this group that indicates dietary specialization has evolved multiple times from insect-feeding ancestors. Nectar feeding and carnivory have each evolved twice, the inclusion of some fruit in the diet has evolved 5 times, and blood-feeding and extreme frugivory have evolved one time each. Repeated instances of the evolution of dietary specializations enable analyses that separate host diet and environment from phylogeny as drivers of bacterial community structure. To date, we have collected 96 fecal samples for 38 species that span the dietary diversity of the clade. All of these samples were collected in the field in Belize and Ecuador, and thus represent the microbiome of these bats in their natural habitat. We would like to generate 16S and shotgun metagenomic sequences for these samples to assess community membership and function. This project represents a significant step forward in the characterization of vertebrate microbiome because it enables hypotheses on the relative importance of different factors in structuring bacterial communities to be explicitly tested.

Biochar is therefore an emerging and attractive replacement for classical farming practices with the additional benefit of sequestering carbon that would otherwise be burnt or composted. The mechanisms behind the beneficial properties of biochar are not well understood, but initial work has shown that its amendment to soil impacts on microbial community composition. To better understand these processes, this project will obtain a comprehensive picture of the microbial community in bulk soil, roots and biochar particles in agricultural soils that were supplemented with various amounts of biochar as part of a field trial executed by the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries (DPI).

In urban environments, green roofs provide a number of potential benefits, including decreases in urban heat island effects and reduced energy costs for buildings. However, they may also serve as habitat islands for maintaining biodiversity across the landscape, similarly to city parks. In this project, eleven experimental green roofs were sampled in addition to five city parks. The green roofs were spread across all five boroughs of New York City and were established in 2010 on top of select recreation centers run by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. All experimental green roofs were planted with the same density of native plant communities from the greater New York area and had identical soil substrate and planting box dimensions. The five city parks chosen for sampling included Central Park, the largest park in New York City, and the High Line, which is the newest large park established in the city. From each green roof, six composite soil cores (0-10 cm) were taken from six planting boxes (each box 4 m X 2 m) for a total of six representative samples per green roof. On three of the green roofs, we sampled in a spatially-explicit manner to capture fine-scale heterogeneity in microbial composition. For these samples, 10 individual soil cores were collected from three planting boxes for a total of 30 soil cores per roof. From each city park, three plots (20 m X 20 m) were sampled and five soil cores (0 to 10 cm) were composited as a representative sample for each plot. In Central Park, five plots were sampled rather than three plots due to the larger size of the park.

The authors use the term ""invisible soil"" paraphrasing the ""invisible forest"" coined by Paul Falkowski to refer to the hidden but gigantic primary productivity found in the photic zone. The diversity of metabolic enzymes involved in resilient organic compounds degradation was very high. However, many microbes could complement their heterotrophic metabolism with chemolithotrophic energy supplies and, specifically in the Mediterranean, the oxidation of carbon monoxide, probably released by tectonic activity, could be important. There is also evidence that the microbes rarely live isolated. The free living planktonic lifestyle is probably not very popular in this extremely depleted environment. Quorum sensing genes indicate that instead, microbes tend to aggregate in particles and they could become luminescent maybe to attract and be eaten by animals. This strategy could provide the cells with a sporadic visit to the nutritious oasis of an animal gut. Overall, this paper shows that the deep ocean possesses a rich and mostly unknown microbiota that deserves much more studies.

A recent analysis of a metagenomic library from the deep Mediterranean shows a surprising high number of quorum sensing or lux genes that are only expressed when bacteria live in colonies. The deep ocean might be too depleted in resources for microbes to live independently. Instead the association to detritus particles might give them a rich microenvironment. Now, some of the genes detected have been positively identified as luxA, directly involved in bioluminescence.

Why would deep sea bacteria be luminescent? One possible explanation is that they become attractive to animals that at these depths are very photosensitive.

Yet deep within the frozen ground of northern latitude soils reside microbial communities that can remain active during the winter months. As we have shown previously, microbial communities may remain active in permafrost soils just below the freezing point of water. Though perhaps more importantly, microbial communities persist in unfrozen areas of water, soil, and sediment beneath water bodies the entire year. Microbial activity in taliks may have significant impacts on biogeochemical cycling in northern latitude ecosystems because their activity is not limited by the winter months. Here we present compositional and functional data, including long term incubation data, for microbial communities within permafrost landscapes, in permafrost and taliks, and the implications of these activities on permafrost carbon decomposition and the flux of CO2 and CH4. Our experiment was conducted at the Alaska Peatland Experiment (APEX) within the Bonanza Creek LTER in interior Alaska. Our site consists of a black spruce forest on permafrost that has degraded into thermokarst bogs at various times over the last five hundred years. We assume the parent substrate of the deep (1-1.5m) thermokarst peat was similar to the nearby forest soil and permafrost C before thaw. At this site, flux tower and autochamber data show that the thermokarst bog is a sink of CO2 , but a significant source of CH4. Yet this does not tell the whole story as these data do not fully capture microbial activity within the deep unfrozen talik layer. There is published evidence that within thermokarst bogs, relatively rapid decomposition of old forest floor material may be occurring. There are several possible mechanisms for this pattern; one possible mechanism for accelerated decomposition is the overwintering activities of microbial communities in taliks of thermokarst soils. To test this idea, we conducted anaerobic incubations of deep (1m) bog soils at two different temperatures to determine microbial temperature response functions. We also measured soil profile CO2 and CH4 concentrations and functional gene assays of the deep bog microbial community. Incubation data in combination with overwinter temperature profiles show that the talik has high potential rates of CO2 and CH4 production compared to the mass of C from forest floor and permafrost C to 1m depth. Results highlight the potential importance of taliks affecting the vulnerability of permafrost carbon to decomposition and reduction to methane.nd low-permeability continental crystalline crust is abundant but remains relatively unexplored.

Through this project, plant ecologists, biogeochemists, soil scientists, and climate modelers, are empirically documenting the effects of climate and land-use change on this arid ecosystem. Though many global change studies strive to link ecosystem shifts to microbial mechanisms, few have integrated edaphic, floristic and climatic data with microbial community data produced by Next-Generation Sequencing techniques, as is being done in the PIRE Mongolia Project. Moreover, the experimental design is comparable to numerous other climate change studies, allowing for the production of globally relevant data. Presently, 16S pyrosequencing data is being analyzed from the soil microbial community of this well replicated, multi-factorial experiment, which includes warming, watering, grazing and topography treatments. The average annual temperature at the Lake Hvsgl Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site has increased by 1.7C since 1963, and some of the greatest projected increases in temperature are associated with northern Mongolia. Hence, this site is therefore ideally suited for studying ecological shifts driven by climate change. One of the initial hypotheses in this moisture-limited system is that microbial diversity will decrease with warming and increase with watering. In order to unravel the microbial community composition of the system, 16S data will be integrated with spatial and temporal data that includes information on carbon and nitrogen fluxes, changes in plant phenology and shifts in climate.",magnificent mongolian microbes,SUBMITTED,2019-02-25T15:21:41,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003853/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003853/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003853/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Environmental:Terrestrial:Soil', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Environmental:Terrestrial:Soil'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003853/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003853/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003853/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003853,4.1,root:Environmental:Terrestrial:Soil

Fossil microbialites represent some of the earliest remnants of life on ancient Earth, and were common from ~2.5 billion to 540 million years ago. Today, microbialites are found in environments where conditions are often too harsh for most organisms. However, the microbialites in both Pavilion and Kelly lakes have provided a new environment for the scientific community to study. These lakes demonstrate that large and uniquely shaped structures can also occur in non-extreme environments that also support fish, plants and other species. The microbialites of these modern lakes are relevant to our understanding of ancient microbiaites that were once common and diverse on early Earth, as such, Pavilion Lake has become an exciting field site for Earth scientists and astrobiologists who are interested in the application of the PLRP research to the search for life in our solar system and beyond. The PLRP was founded in 2004, and has grown in exciting new directions ever since. During the 2004 field season, PLRP scientists discovered microbialites in Kelly Lake, which is approximately 20 km NW from Pavilion Lake. The PLRP team will be taking their DeepWorker Science and Exploration (DSE) program to Kelly Lake in 2011. These research activities complement those that have taken place at Pavilion Lake since 2008, and will help to broaden our understanding of modern microbialite-rich environments. Further to these science activities, the PLRP supports a thriving human exploration research component.

Carbon flow reconstructions based on stable isotopic compositions of whole archaeal cells, intact archaeal membrane lipids, and other sedimentary carbon pools indicate that these Archaea assimilate sedimentary organic compounds other than methane even though methanotrophy accounts for a major fraction of carbon cycled in these ecosystems. Oxidation of methane by members of Marine Benthic Group B and the Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotal Group without assimilation of methane carbon provides a plausible explanation. Maintenance energies of these subsurface communities appear to be orders of magnitude lower than minimum values known from laboratory observations, and ecosystem-level carbon budgets suggest that community turnover times are on the order of 100 to 2,000 years.

The Antarctic Dry Valley system offers unprecedented access to a trophically simple biological system that appears to be solely structured by abiotic environmental drivers. The primary biology in this system is microbial. Linking a range of high-resolution remote sensing data with over 600 person days in the field, the 220 km2 3 valley NZTABS survey now includes over 650 spatially strategic soil samples targeting the diversity habitats in the system. Each sample and site has been analyzed for a range of geochemistry as well as a comprehensive survey of biology (all visible vegetation, insects, all infauna and flora (nematodes, rotifers, tartigrades), and microbiology). The initial microbial surveys (Bacteria, Cyanobacteria, fungi) were carried only using DNA fingerprinting analysis. All of the information has been placed into and interactive GIS framework allowing direct relationships between all parameters to be queried. The central objective of the survey is to determine the primary environmental drivers for structuring the biology to enable us to develop a model that can predict the distribution of biology across the entire Dry Valley system (6500 km2) using only remote sensing.

This is more than double the size of the atmospheric carbon pool but the estimates are still quite uncertain and might be even higher. It is however estimated that 25 percent of this large carbon pool in Arctic soils will be lost by the end of the 21st century and will be released to the atmosphere as CO2 (Gruber et al., 2004). The subduction of organic-rich material from the surface to deeper layers caused by repeated freezing and thawing of the active layer during Arctic summer is assumed to be a major mechanism of carbon storage in the Arctic. These cryoturbations are spatially widely distributed and store high amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC). Decomposition of recent cryoturbated carbon is strongly retarded thereby essentially taking out this fraction of SOC from the current carbon cycle. Todays primary concern and research focus is the vulnerability of cryoturbated SOC due to global warming which is predicted to lead to intensified decomposition and elevated greenhouse gas emissions. Here we present a study that aims to provide a comprehensive picture of the microbial community structure of permafrost-affected and cryoturbated soils of different Northern latitude permafrost regions in Siberia and Greenland. For this purpose, soil samples were collected in northeast Siberia in a transect along the upper Kolyma river, and in the Zackenberg region, Greenland. The sampling scheme covered several bioclimatic subzones and vegetation types. We are currently analysing data retrieved from SSU amplicon sequencing, the quantification of several functional groups involved in carbon cycling and physico-chemical analyses in order to predict potential microbial regulators in SOC storage.

In this study we present a comprehensive analysis of the biogeographic patters of Arctic microbiome diversity and distribution along two oceanographic transects in the Marginal Ice Zone around Svalbard, within strong environmental gradients (Ripfjorden, Kongsfjorden). A total of 11 stations were sample at three depths (surface, chlorophyll maximum and bottom) during the Norwegian Polar Institute MOSJ-ICE 2016 plankton-monitoring program. Samples were concentrated on board through Sterivex 0.2 mm filtration and preserved at -80ºC for later DNA extraction. Amplification of 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes were performed and sequenced in Illumina MiSeq with a sequence depth of about 100 thousand readpairs. The prokaryotic and eukaryotic MOSJ-ICE16 data sets collection comprises highly complex and diverse microbial communities with a marked biogeographic pattern of distribution.

Thus, alternatives are sought for the use of growth promoters and antimicrobials in animal production. Recent research demonstrates the potential of applying essential oils (OEs) in several areas as potential substitutes for antibiotics. This is because they have characteristics similar to these products. However, there are few data in the literature regarding the actions of OEs in axenic cultures of anaerobic ruminal microorganisms. Thus, a project is proposed to: evaluate the efficacy of essential oils from the sequencing of rumen microorganisms of finished cattle in confinement; determine the genes expressed by the ruminal microbiota; identify pure cultures affected by the presence of OEs; to observe the effect of OEs on ruminal bacteria by electron microscopy; to evaluate the microbial resistance of OEs in ruminal bacteria; and evaluate the metatranscriptome of axenic culture of ruminal bacteria cultured with OEs. It is expected to identify species strongly affected by OEs and metabolic routes and mechanisms used by ruminal microorganisms to deal with the presence of OEs and their active compounds.

In contrast, archaeal communities were less affected by pH. More geographically distant sites had more dissimilar communities (r = 0.443, P = 0.030). Variance partitioning analysis showed that geographic distance (historical contingencies) contributed more to bacterial community variation (12.2%) than any other factor, although the environmental factors explained more variance when combined (28.9%).

The proposal aimed to tackle two core hypotheses: 1-The dominant microbiota associated with human skin is rapidly transferred to surfaces in a home, masking microbiota signatures left from previous interactions with the surface, 2-The composition and relative abundance of members of the dominant microbial community associated with human skin are maintained following transfer to a surface. To test these hypotheses the project aimed to generate 16S rRNA data from hand, foot and gut samples of 18 individuals in seven representative groups. In addition, we proposed to collect surface samples from two internal door knobs, a kitchen counter, the bedroom and bathroom floors and a light switch from each surveyed home, every-other day for two weeks prior to moving in and four weeks following the move into a new home (Table 1). The Home Microbiome Study collected a total of 1,609 microbial samples from seven houses, 18 people, three dogs, and one cat.

Studies to date have been correlational because of the difficulty in cultivating their constituent species in pure culture. Here we investigate the causal link between methanogenesis and diversity in laboratory anaerobic digesters by experimentally manipulating the diversity of cultures by dilution and subsequent equilibration of biomass. This process necessarily leads to the loss of the rarer species from communities. We find a positive relationship between methane production and the number of taxa, with little evidence of functional saturation, suggesting that rare species play an important role in methane producing communities. No correlations were found between the initial composition and methane production across natural communities, but a positive relationship between species richness and methane production emerged following ecological selection imposed by the laboratory conditions.

In this research, we hypothesized that differences in operational parameters lead to a particular composition and organization of microbial communities in full-scale installations.

Microbial community analysis was carried out by means of amplicon sequencing and real-time PCR.

We collected and cultured 11 samples of acidic water from the Volcan mining company (4261 m.a.s.l) located in the city of Cerro de Pasco, the Huarón mine (4534 m.a.s.l) located in the district of Huayllay, and Yanamate Lake (4358 m.a.s.l) located at the southeast of Cerro de Pasco city. We obtained 6 MPCL that oxidized copper sulfide 0.5%(w/v) and zinc sulfide 0.5%(w/v) at 5ºC. Growth kinetics of the 6 MPCL were evaluated and doubling times of 49.5 hours for CuS and 60.8 hours for ZnS were obtained. The release of copper kinetics on a sulphide ore and synthetic sulphide (CuS) were evaluated, obtaining better results in CuS, where copper (II) was released to 1.51 mg/L for every 10^5 cells/ml. Metagenomic DNA of the 6 consortia were extracted. The amplicons libraries were built and sequenced using 27F and 518R primers. The consortia were mostly composed for the genus Acidithiobacillus sp. and only in one of them Leptospirillum ferroxidans was present.",Metagenomic analysis of microbial psychrotolerant consortia leaching of metal sulfides at low temperatures.,SUBMITTED,2018-11-25T17:36:21,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003495/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003495/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003495/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Engineered:Bioreactor', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Engineered:Bioreactor'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003495/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003495/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003495/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003495,4.1,root:Engineered:Bioreactor

The concept can be applied ex situ as ‘biological upgrading' to biogas from anaerobic digestion, and is usually carried out at thermophilic temperatures (>50°C) in order to accelerate methanogenesis. The ex situ methanogenic community responsible for this upgrading is currently poorly characterised but is expected to feature abundant methanogens specialising in fixation of CO2 and H2 to CH4. Given the lack of a digestion feedstock, the importance of bacteria in an upgrading community is less clear. In this study, the methanogenic and microbial communities involved in thermophilic ex situ upgrading of a 1 CO2 : 4 H2 mix were characterised during disruption and restoration of biogas production due to a process shift to higher temperatures (55°C to 65°C). Although DGGE, 16S clone library and 16S pyrosequencing approaches showed Methanothermobacter to be the dominant methanogen throughout operation, no relationship was evident between decreased upgrading function and Methanothermobacter abundance. Instead, it is possible that biogas production was restored through addition of organic and/or inorganic substrate in a re-inoculation event. This implies a role for the ex situ bacterial community, the majority of which (>50% reads) belong to uncharacterised Firmicutes taxa, in particular the MBA03 group.",M'thermobacter and ex situ biogas upgrading,SUBMITTED,2018-11-25T17:35:51,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003494/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003494/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003494/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Engineered:Biogas plant', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Engineered:Biogas%20plant'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003494/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003494/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003494/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003494,4.1,root:Engineered:Biogas plant

Trials showed that although BioMethane Potential (BMP) was highest in 100% silage tests, generation of biomethane was more stable with a 20% inclusion of dairy slurry (by VS%). At higher loading rates BM output in 100% silage (R-G) and 80%silage:20% slurry (R-SG) reached parity, possibly an effect of incomplete degradation of solids within the retention time, but may also be imformed by the microbial community created by increased rate of feedstock addition.Another trend documented both in the original study  and more broadly  is the decline in reactor stability with increased organic loading rate (OLR), as measured by the FOSTAC ratio (effectively the reactor's buffering capability and frequently an indicator for process stability). Increases in OLR from 2.5 to 3 kgVS/m3/d led to rapid accumulation of VFAs (AcO, PrO) in R-G, while no issue was observed over the course of R-SG operation. Due to the constant turnover of organic material and active biology of the reactor community, issues with reactor operation are frequently linked to limiting concentrations of trace elements such as Fe, Co, Ni, etc.. However it is not externally apparent which portions of the community are restricted by the lack of trace elements (TE) - this study aims to characterise the communities stressed by Wall et al., 2014, and determine which populations relate to bottlenecking of (TE).The two reactors characterised in this study (R-G,R- SG) were sampled over 68 and 65 weeks respectively after being seeded from the same sludge inoculum, fed 100% silage and 80:20% silage:slurry, and operated along the same design principles.

These properties have been recently exploited therapeutically to treat human diseases. The bio-complexity of the intestinal lumen would suggest that interactions between parasite and intestinal microbiota would also influence inflammation.  In this study, we characterized the porcine proximal colon microbiota in response to Trichuris suis (whipworm) infection using 16S rDNA-based and whole genome shotgun (WGS) approaches.  A 21-day T. suis infection in pigs induced a profound change in the composition of the proximal colon microbiota. The abundance of four of the 15 phyla identified, such as Proteobacteria, was changed in infected pigs. Approximately 10% of genera were significantly altered by infection. Notably, reduced Succinivibrio abundance in infected pigs implied that T. suis infection altered carbohydrate metabolism in the proximal colon microbial ecosystem. Conversely, Mucispirillum was significantly increased in infected pigs suggesting that mucosal disruption induced by parasitic infection and feeding perturbed this ecological niche. Infection led to a significant shift in the metabolic potential of the proximal colon microbiota. Approximately 26% of all metabolic pathways indentified were affected by infection. Two important functional categories repressed by infection were carbohydrate metabolism and lysine biosynthesis. Furthermore, changes in pathogen associated pathways suggested that T. suis infection could impact subsequent infection and modulate host-pathogen interactions. Our findings should facilitate development of strategies for parasitic control in pigs and humans and optimize successful helminth therapy to reduce inflammation.",Alterations in the colon microbiota induced by the gastrointestinal nematode Trichuris suis,HARVESTED,2018-11-02T14:21:33,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003439/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003439/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003439/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Mammals:Digestive system', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Mammals:Digestive%20system'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003439/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003439/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003439/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003439,4.1,root:Host-associated:Mammals:Digestive system

We report that the parasitic nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis induces changes in the expression of antimicrobial peptides that are associated with marked microbial composition shifts, including reductions of segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), a group of Gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming Clostridia, in ileal, jejunal, colon and fecal samples. SFB reduction correlates with decreased intestinal expression of T helper 17 (Th17) cell response markers. While infection of mice genetically deficient in the type 2 response-inducing signature cytokine IL-13 and the STAT6-activated cell signaling pathway failed to reproduce these phenotypes, administration of the type 2 response-inducing cytokine IL-25 activated a similar response in wild type mice as infection with N. brasiliensis. The reduced capacity to evoke Th17 responses resulted in increased susceptibility of N. brasiliensis-infected mice to co-infection with the bacterial pathogen Citrobacter rodentium.

While bacterioplankton communities in the Baltic Sea are strongly structured by its salinity, how MBIs impact the composition and distribution of those communities is unknown. However, insights into this relationship were afforded by an exceptional MBI in 2014 that brought saline and oxygenated water into the basins of the central Baltic Sea. Following this event, we analyzed bacterioplankton community composition in the inflowing water and in the uplifted former bottom water at stations in the Western and central Baltic Sea that were reached by the MBI. Bacterial diversity data were compared with data on the respective communities obtained during a previous non-inflow situation involving the same locations. In contrast to the broad taxonomic changes in bacterial community composition that are generally associated with changes in salinity, significant changes following the 2014 MBI were mainly at the genus level. The relative similarity of the bacterial communities in the inflowing and uplifted waters as well as the results from an inflow-simulating numerical model indicated that the inflowing water did not originate directly from the North Sea but mostly from adjacent areas in the Baltic Sea. These findings further suggested that the inflow event led to a series of shifts in Baltic Sea water mass among the Baltic Sea basins and a gradual mixing of the water bodies. Dramatic changes in bacterial community composition between inflowing and uplifted waters did become visible when the bottom-water inflow reached the anoxic, sulfidic deep basins, resulting in an uplifting of the former anoxic bacterial community, dominated by the Epsilonproteobacterium Sulfurimonas spp., to water depths within the oxygenated layer. Our study of the impact of MBIs on bacterioplankton communities therefore highlights two relevant underlying mechanisms that impact the distribution and possibly also the activities of planktonic bacteria in the Baltic Sea: the successive dilution of inflowing North Sea with ambient waters and the uplifting of former bottom-water communities to higher water strata.",Impact of a major inflow event on the composition and distribution of bacterioplankton communities in the Baltic Sea,SUBMITTED,2018-10-09T12:20:48,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003164/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003164/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003164/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Marginal Sea', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Marginal%20Sea'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003164/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003164/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003164/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003164,4.1,root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Marginal Sea

in Esmeraldas Province, Ecuador. School-age children were screened for 
the presence of STH infections and allocated to one of 3 groups: 
uninfected, T. trichiura only, and mixed infections with T. trichiura 
and Ascaris lumbricoides. A sample of uninfected children and those with 
T. trichiura infections only were treated with albendazole (800 mg/day 
for 3 days) and ivermectin (single dose of 200 ug/kg), and stool samples 
were collected 3 weeks post-treatment. Bacterial DNA was extracted using 
the FastDNA Spin kit for soil, and bacterial community profiles were 
studied by 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes. This generated 999,796 
sequences, which were processed and analysed using mothur.

Results: Microbiota analyses were done using stool samples from 97 
children aged 8-14 years of whom 30 were not infected, 17 were infected 
with T. trichiura alone, and 50 had mixed infections with both T. 
trichiura and A. lumbricoides. Post-treatment samples were analyzed for 
14 of the 17 children initially infected with T. trichiura alone and 21 
of 30 uninfected children. Treatment resulted in 100% cure of STH 
infections. Comparisons of the microbiota at different taxonomic levels 
showed no statistically significant differences in composition between 
uninfected children and those with T. trichiura infections. A surprising 
finding was a decreased proportional abundance of a few bacterial genera 
from the clostridia class of Firmicutes, in tandem with a reduced 
overall bacterial diversity, among children with mixed infections 
compared to either uninfected children or those with T. trichiura 
infections only, indicating a specific effect of A. lumbricoides 
infection on intestinal microbiota.  Anthelmintic treatment of children 
with T. trichiura did not appear to alter composition of faecal microbiota.

Discussion: This is the first molecular study to analyse the effect of 
whipworm infection on the human intestinal microbiota. Our data indicate 
that T. trichiura infections alone have no effect on the faecal 
microbiota of children living in endemic communities, but that A. 
lumbricoides colonisation might be associated with a disturbed 
microbiota. Our results also catalogue the microbiota that is present in 
rural Ecuadorians, and indicate that there are differences between this 
cohort and individuals from more urban, industrialised societies.",Human_infections_with_the_whipworm__Trichuris_trichiura__are_not_associated_with_alterations_in_the_faecal_microbiota_,SUBMITTED,2018-09-19T09:49:46,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003135/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003135/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003135/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Fecal'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003135/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003135/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003135/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003135,4.1,root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal

Along the water column, they are useful markers of the trophic state of water masses, therefore representing useful ecological indicators in the surveyed areas. In this study in the southern Adriatic Sea bacteria were quantified by flow cytometry and their diversity assessed by high-throughput sequencing (HTS). In addition, the most represented bacterial groups were quantified by qPCR. The samples were collected from the surface to the seabed, at a total of 16 different depths at four stations in the southern Adriatic Sea, during the late winter BIOTA (BIO-Tracing Adriatic water masses) cruise conducted in 2016. The investigated area showed an unusual circulation characterized by a mixed layer down to 200 m, which differed from the usual winter convection conditions, typical of middle-altitude ecosystems and important for the seasonal picoplankton dynamics in the South Adriatic Sea. Heterotrophic bacteria were separated into HNA (relative High Nucleic Acid content) and LNA (Low Nucleic Acid content) subpopulations with abundances up to 1.8 x 105 and 8.8 x 105 cells/mL, respectively. HNA populations dominated at offshore stations reaching their maximum at depths below the euphotic zone. The bacterial community was dominated by Alphaproteobacteria accounting for > 40% of the total, represented by the SAR11 clade (90.84%), followed by Marinimicrobia (18% of the total), mainly represented by clade SAR406 (8.44%). However, distinctive bacterial groups were found in euphotic layer (Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria) and aphotic layer samples (Deltaproteobacteria, Marinimicrobia, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria and Planctomycetes). qPCR assays confirmed HTC results with abundances of targeted bacterial groups found to vary between different sampling points and sampling depths and values ranging from 8.7 x 103 to 9.13 x 105 copy number/mL for Alphaproteobacteria, from 1.44 x 104 to 5.11 x 105 copy number/mL for Gammaproteobacteria and from 1.8 x 103 to 2.4 x 105 copy number/mL for Bacteriodetes.

Dives with the submersible JAGO showed accumulations of organic matter forming dark patches on the seafloor, which were covered by mat-forming whitish microbial filaments. Where the Black Sea chemocline met the seabed (between 150 - 170 m), these mats covered between 25 to 55 % of the seafloor, and appeared to form a belt of 3 km width. The mats were composed of Beggiatoa-like large filamentous sulfur bacteria based on 16S rRNA sequences from the mat. The microbial community under the mats was enriched with taxa affiliated with polymer degrading, fermenting and sulfate reducing microorganisms. Under the mats, higher organic matter accumulation, as well as higher remineralization and sulfate reduction rates were measured compared to outside the mat. Mat-covered and mat-free sediments showed similar degradability of the bulk organic matter pool, suggesting that the higher sulfide fluxes and subsequent development of the thiotrophic mats in the patches are consequences of the accumulation of organic matter rather than its qualitative composition. Our observations suggest that the key factors for the distribution of thiotrophic mat-forming communities near to the Crimean shelf break are (1) hypoxic conditions repressing grazers and favoring thiotrophic bacteria and (2) the specific seafloor topography that enhances the accumulation of labile organic matter.","Distribution and composition of thiotrophic mats in the hypoxic zone of the Black Sea (150-170m water depth, Crimea margin)",SUBMITTED,2018-09-13T11:39:05,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003075/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003075/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003075/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Sediment', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Sediment'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003075/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003075/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003075/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003075,4.1,root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Sediment

However, we know relatively little about the forces shaping their large-scale ecological ranges, community assembly and stability over time. As for many living surfaces in the marine environment, the epiphytic bacterial biofilm communities on macro algae such as Macrocystis pyrifera, and the mechanisms that drive their assembly are poorly understood, apart from the magnitude and diversity of their composition. This biodiversity is not lacking for possible explanations, from colonization to dispersal, succession and persistence by competition. High throughput sequencing has contributed to a variety of potential mechanisms being proposed to characterize the assembly of these microbial communities. We used 454 parallel tag pyrosequencing of the 16s rna gene to better explore the diversity, stability and specificity of the microbial communities associated with the dominant kelp species in Monterey Bay. We also compared the kelp-associated communities with those present in the surrounding seawater to assess the influence of environmental conditions. Our results reveal patterns in the distribution of individual bacterial members at multiple levels of phylogenetic resolution within and around a M. pyrifera ecosystem suggesting the lack of a proposed stable core community of species associated with marine macro algae across space and time (Tujula et al., 2010). M. pyrifera harbors species-specific and temporally adapted epiphytic bacterial biofilms on their surfaces, and the most cosmopolitan taxa are also the most abundant in individual assemblages. Since several of the kelp-specific bacteria identified were highly similar to other bacteria known to either avoid subsequent colonization by eukaryotic larvae or to exhibit antibacterial activities, host-specific bacterial associations might play an important role for M. pyrifera.

With fringing and patch reefs at varying distances from the coast the Spermonde Archipelago in southern Sulawesi, Indonesia offers ideal conditions to study the effects of coastal eutrophication along a spatially defined gradient. The present study investigated bacterial community composition of three coral reef habitats: the water column, sediments and mucus of the hard coral genus Fungia, along that cross-shelf environmental and water quality gradient. The main research questions were: (1) How do bacterial communities respond to changes in water quality along a spatial gradient? (2) Which water quality parameters influence the  bacterial community composition? (3) Are there bacteria community differences between the different investigated microbial habitats? For this purpose a range of key water parameters were measured at 8 stations in distances from 2 to 55 km from urban Makassar. This was supplemented by sampling of bacterial communities of important microbial habitats using 454 pyrosequencing. Findings revealed that the population center Makassar had a strong effect on the concentrations of Chlorophyll a, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and transparent exopolymer particles (TEP), which were all significantly elevated at the inshore compared the other 7 sites. Shifts in the bacterial communities were specific to each sampled habitat. In the water column, the relative abundance of Gammaproteobacteria increased with distance from Makassar, while that of Alphaproteobacteria decreased.In the sediments, there was a pronounced dominance of Gammaproteobacteria at the inshore site, which decreased along the gradient. There was no gradual shift in bacterial classes for samples obtained from the Fungia mucus. We observed a strong positive correlation between Bacteroidia, Chlamydiia and Acidobacteria_Gp6 and chlorophyll a, TEP and SPM. Deinocooci, Verrumicrobiae and Alphaproteobacteria were, on the other hand, positively correlated to DOC concentrations. In addition, we observed very distinct communities between the investigated habitats. Our data shows strong changes in the bacterial community composition at the inshore site for water column and sediment samples. Alarmingly, this led to a much higher prevalence of potentially pathogenic bacteria at the chronically impacted site closest to Makassar.","Coastal eutrophication controls the bacterial community composition in different reef habitats of the Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia.",SUBMITTED,2018-09-05T23:01:47,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002882/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002882/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002882/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002882/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002882/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002882/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002882,4.1,root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine

Marine sediment prokaryotes play crucial roles in regional biogeochemical cycling. However, the sediment prokaryotic community assembly and metabolic potential in this ecosystem had not been revealed on an extended spatial scale. We collected surface sediment samples across sixe typical zones (Yushan, Xiangshan Harbor, Hangzhou Bay, eastern Zhoushan Islands, eastern Xiangshan, and Sanmen Bay) of this area and combine 16S rRNA gene sequencing, community-level metabolic reconstruction, and sediment physicochemical measurement to investigate the variations in taxonomic composition and metabolic gene family composition with geography and related environmental conditions. Geographic distance effect won the arm-race in shaping beta-diversity pattern with the major environmental drivers such as oil, temperature, texture, sulfide, and water depth, but left larger proportion of unexplained variation, suggesting the effects of unmeasured factors and stochastic process. We found discriminant assemblages across the zones, suggesting some provincial distributions of prokaryotes. On the other hand, the predicted metabolic potential structure slightly but significantly shifts with geography. The key roles of sulfide and oil in shaping metabolic potential structure suggested the importance of sulfur (S) metabolism in biogeochemical cycling here. Particularly, we found that sulfate reduction was the dominant pathway in S-metabolism in the Yushan sediments as indicated by the evidences from taxonomic composition, predicted enzyme-level gene, and metabolic product.

However, the interaction between copepods and bacteria is poorly understood in the marine environment. Herein, we investigated the nitrogen and phosphorus compounds excreted by copepods fed by two size fractions of natural food (<20 µm and 20-150 µm) in the upwelling zone of central south of Chile in late summer and spring. We then assessed the biogeochemical response of the bacterial community and their structure, in terms of total and active cells, to the addition of these dissolved compounds. Results revealed that copepods actively excreted nitrogen and phosphorus compounds, mainly in the form of ammonium and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP), reaching excretion rates up to 2.6 µmol L-1 h-1 and 0.05 µmol L-1 h-1, respectively, in spring. The high accumulation of excreted nitrogen and phosphorus was associated in both periods with the 20-150 µm size fraction of food, which coincided with the main food item available for copepods in the field. Variation in the abundance (contribution to total bacterial sequences) of bacteria taxa was characterized by a decrease of Bacteroidetes and Cyanobacteria, and an increase of Proteobacteria, mainly Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria depending on treatment. Some orders, such as Flavobacteriales presented a rapid response to the products excreted by copepods, increasing their abundance between 3 to 10% in the first four hours of the experiment evolution. Moreover, the specific bacterial activity (16S rRNA: rDNA) suggested a differential response associated with the two size fractions of food provided to copepods, Alphaproteobacteria was stimulated in the treatment enrichment with excretion products by copepods fed with <20 µm size fraction, but inhibited at the 20-150 µm size fraction in March. In December, Alphaproteobacteria was active in both treatments, but in the treatment enriched with excretion products by copepods fed with <20 µm size fraction was higher than the treatment enriched with excretion products by copepods fed with 20-150 µm size fraction. Our findings indicate that the different size fractions of food provided to copepods have an impact on the main products excreted by copepods and showed that bacterial community can respond in a short period of time (<4 h) to excreted organic and inorganic substrates.",Dissolved compounds excreted by copepods reshape the diversity and the activity of marine bacterioplankton community,SUBMITTED,2018-09-04T16:27:57,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002808/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002808/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002808/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002808/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002808/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002808/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002808,4.1,root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine

These includeing, but are not limited to: H2S formation, souring and corrosion caused mainly by sulfate-reducing microorganisms. To prevent biogenic sulfate reduction, nitrate can be used as an environmentally friendly alternative to biocides. However, side effects of nitrate injection are sometimes observed but not well understood. In our study, we used original water from an onshore reservoir, where a microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) application is planned, and investigated the effects of nitrate addition on H2S generation, mineral precipitation and microbiology. We observed that nitrate did inhibit H2S formation in most, but not all cases while available in the medium. During nitrate reduction, iron and calcite minerals precipitated over short- and long-term (10 or 160 days) incubations. This was caused by a nitrate-reducing group of bacteria belonging to the family Deferribacteraceae. Using dynamic sandpack setups and numerical modeling approaches with the simulator TOUGHREACT, we observed significant reduction in permeabilities (~44x) suggesting injectivity issues over time in case nitrate is continuously added to the reservoir. Our study shows that nitrate-dependent processes, which were described separately for pure-cultures before, are also valid for natural mixed communities present in oil fields and underlines the complex interplay of microbial metabolisms associated with those communities.",Microbial induced mineral precipitations caused by nitrate treatment for souring control during microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR),SUBMITTED,2018-08-02T08:53:39,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002698/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002698/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002698/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Environmental:Terrestrial:Oil reservoir', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Environmental:Terrestrial:Oil%20reservoir'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002698/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002698/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002698/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002698,4.1,root:Environmental:Terrestrial:Oil reservoir

Metagenomic analysis shows that the intestine of humans and animals harbors various commensal viruses and the dysbiosis is often associated with intestinal infection and inflammatory diseases, but the role and mechanism of commensal viruses in the homeostasis of intestinal immune system remain unexplored. Here, we show that commensal viruses are essential for the homeostasis of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). The cytosolic viral RNA sensing receptor RIG-I in antigen presenting cells can recognize commensal viruses and maintain IELs via an interferon-independent, but MAVS-IRF1-IL-15 axis dependent manner. Notably, the recovery of IELs restores the colitis susceptibility of commensal viruses-depleted mice to dextran sulfate sodium.

Specialized myrmecophagous (ant- and termite-eating) placental mammals represent a textbook example of evolutionary convergence driven by extreme diet specialization. Armadillos, anteaters, aardvarks, pangolins, and aardwolves thus provide a model system for understanding the potential role of gut microbiota in the convergent adaptation to myrmecophagy. Here, we expand upon previous mammalian gut microbiome studies by using high-throughput barcoded Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize the composition of gut microbiota in 15 species representing all placental myrmecophagous lineages and their close relatives from zoo- and field-collected samples. We confirm that both diet and phylogeny drive the evolution of mammalian gut microbiota, with cases of convergence in global composition, but also examples of phylogenetic inertia. Our results reveal specialized placental myrmecophages as a spectacular case of large-scale convergence in gut microbiome composition. Indeed, Neighbor-Net networks and beta diversity plots based on UniFrac distances show significant clustering of myrmecophagous species (anteaters, aardvarks, and aardwolves) even though they belong to phylogenetically distant lineages representing different orders. The aardwolf, which diverged from carnivorous hyenas only in the last 10 million years, experienced a convergent shift in the composition of its gut microbiome to become more similar to other myrmecophages. These results confirm diet adaptation to be a major driving factor of convergence in gut microbiome composition over evolutionary timescales. This study sets the scene for future metagenomic studies aiming at evaluating potential convergence in functional gene content in the microbiomes of specialized mammalian myrmecophages.",Convergence of gut microbiomes in myrmecophagous mammals,SUBMITTED,2018-07-27T09:09:39,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002673/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002673/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002673/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Mammals:Digestive system:Fecal', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Mammals:Digestive%20system:Fecal'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002673/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002673/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002673/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002673,4.1,root:Host-associated:Mammals:Digestive system:Fecal

However, the interaction between seaweeds and their environment may also influence community assembly of their microbiota. In this experiment, I ask whether the interaction between water flow and seaweed morphology affects the settlement and structure of microbial biofilms. I test whether three common algal morphologies select for differential biofilm communities using artificial macro algae units (AM units) made out of latex.

Acantharia, globally distributed heterotrophic protists that are unique in building skeletons of celestite (strontium sulfate), can produce reproductive cysts covered by a heavy mineral shell that sink rapidly from surface to deep waters. We combined phylogenetic and biogeochemical analyses to explore the ecological and biogeochemical significance of this reproductive strategy. Phylogenetic analysis of the 18S and 28S rRNA genes of different cyst morphotypes collected in different oceans indicated that cyst-forming Acantharia belong to three early diverging clades from the orders Chaunacanthida and Holacanthida that are mainly heterotrophic. Environmental high-throughput V9 tag sequences and clone libraries showed that the three clades are widely distributed in the Indian, Atlantic and Pacific Oceans at different latitudes, but seem more abundant in regions of higher primary productivity. Moreover, sequences of cyst-forming Acantharia were distributed evenly in both the photic and mesopelagic zone, a vertical distribution that we attribute to their life cycle where flagellated swarmers are released in deep waters from sinking cysts. Bathypelagic sediment traps in the subantarctic and oligotrophic subtropical Atlantic Ocean showed that downward flux of Acantharia was only large at high-latitudes and during a phytoplankton bloom. High organic carbon export in cold waters would be a putative nutritional source for non-symbiotic juveniles ascending in the water column.

Snails were exposed to microplastics and PBDEs independently and in combination for 96 hours. Microplastic particles (13-15 µm nylon powder) were mixed with quartz sand sediment at 1% w/w.

There was no significant mortality observed in any of the treatments after 96 hours exposure. Of the six snails per treatment, three were analysed for PBDE tissue concentration and three were analysed for gut microbiome composition. The presence of microplastics did not significantly change PBDE bioaccumulation. However, our data indicate that that the presence of microplastics did influence gut microbial community diversity. In snails exposed to microplastics only (without PBDEs), microbial diversity was lower compared to those not exposed to microplastics. In the presence of microplastics, with increasing PBDE concentration, gut microbial diversity increased. In comparison, when microplastics were absent microbial communities were less diverse at the higher concentrations. A similar trend is reflected in the community composition data. These data imply that microplastics alone can influence the gut microbial community and they can also alter the effects of PBDEs on the gut microbiome.

A combined total of 1,855 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were recovered as free-living and particle-attached bacterioplankton. Here, a few major OTUs affiliated with Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria accounted for ~93% of all sequences whereas a tail of “rare” OTUs represented most of the diversity. OTUs allied to Surface 1a/b SAR11 clades and Prochlorococcus related to the high light-adapted (HL2) ecotype were the most widespread and predominant sequence types. Interestingly, the frequency of taxa that are typically found in the upper mesopelagic zone was significantly elevated in the northern transects compared to those in the central, presumably as a direct effect of deep convective mixing in the Gulf of Aqaba and waters exchange with the northern Red. Although temperature was the best predictor of species richness across all major lineages, both spatial and environmental distances correlated strongly with genetic distances.

The health and recovery of reefs are strongly influenced by recruitment of coral larvae. Their settlement relies on cues such as those emitted from bacterial communities forming biofilms on reef surfaces. Environmental conditions can change these bacterial community compositions (BCC) and may in turn affect settlement of coral larvae. We investigated BCC and coral larvae settlement at three small inhabited islands with different distance from the mainland in the Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia. BCC and recruitment were analyzed on artificial ceramic tiles after 2-8 weeks exposure time and on natural reef substrate. Environmental analysis showed a clear separation in water parameters between inshore and near-shore/mid-shelf sites, as well as distinct benthic communities at all of the three sites. No coral recruitment was observed at the inshore site with highest anthropogenic impact. At the other two sites coral recruitment occurred on natural surfaces (recruits per 100 cm2: 0.73 ± 1.75 near-shore, 0.90 ± 1.97 mid-shelf), but there was no significant difference between the two sites. On artificial substrates coral recruitment differed between these two sites, with tile orientation and with exposure time of the tiles in the reef. The most abundant bacteria on both substrates were Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Cyanobacteria. BCC was strongly correlated with water quality and significant differences in BCC between the inshore site and near-shore/mid-shelf were found. On artificial substrates there was a significant difference in BCC with exposure time in the reef. Furthermore, bacterial communities on artificial tiles showed changes in their composition after being subjected to higher water temperatures in an experimental setting. We demonstrate how changes in water quality and temperature can affect BCC in coral reefs, which in turn could affect coral recruitment. Small islands such as these investigated feature a high spatial variability, as seen e.g. in environmental gradients, differences in BCC or in coral recruitment. Our study highlights the value of taking both BCC and coral recruitment into account in addition to the environmental conditions, when considering the recovery potential of coral reefs.","Bacterial communitiy compositions on natural and artificial substrates in the Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia",SUBMITTED,2018-07-19T16:53:18,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002562/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002562/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002562/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002562/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002562/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002562/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002562,4.1,root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine

Snow microbial assemblages have been extensively investigated in the Arctic and in the Antarctica, but rarely in mid-latitude mountain areas. In this study, we investigated the bacterial communities of snow collected in four glacierized areas (Alps, Eastern Anatolia, Karakoram and Himalaya) by high-throughput DNA sequencing. We also investigated the origin of the air masses that produced the sampled snowfalls by reconstructing back-trajectories. A standardized approach was applied to all the analyses in order to ease comparison among different communities and geographical areas. The bacterial communities hosted from 25 to 211 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), and their structure differed significantly between geographical areas. This suggests that snow bacterial communities may largely derive from ‘local' air bacteria, maybe by deposition of airborne particulate of local origin that occurs during snowfall. However, some evidence suggest that a contribution of bacteria collected during air mass uplift to snow communities cannot be excluded, particularly when the air mass that originated the snow event is particularly rich in dust.","Bacterial diversity in snow from mid-latitude mountain areas: Alps, Eastern Anatolia, Karakoram and Himalaya.",SUBMITTED,2018-07-18T09:54:41,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002543/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002543/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002543/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Environmental:Aquatic:Freshwater:Ice', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Environmental:Aquatic:Freshwater:Ice'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002543/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002543/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002543/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002543,4.1,root:Environmental:Aquatic:Freshwater:Ice

However, difficulties in correctly identifying zooplankton hinder our understanding of their roles in marine ecosystem functioning, and can prevent detection of long term changes in their community structure. The advent of massively parallel next generation sequencing technology allows DNA sequence data to be recovered directly from whole community samples. Here we assess the ability of such sequencing to quantify richness and diversity of a mixed zooplankton assemblage from a productive time series site in the Western English Channel. Methodology/Principle Findings: Plankton net hauls (200 µm) were taken at the Western Channel Observatory station L4 in September 2010 and January 2011. These samples were analysed by microscopy and metagenetic analysis of the 18S nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA gene using the 454 pyrosequencing platform. Following quality control a total of 419,041 sequences were obtained for all samples. The sequences clustered into 205 operational taxonomic units using a 97% similarity cut-off. Allocation of taxonomy by comparison with the National Centre for Biotechnology Information database identified 135 OTUs to species level, 11 to genus level and 1 to order, <2.5% of sequences were classified as unknowns. By comparison a skilled microscopic analyst was able to routinely enumerate only 58 taxonomic groups. Conclusions: Metagenetics reveals a previously hidden taxonomic richness, especially for Copepoda and hard-to-identify meroplankton such as Bivalvia, Gastropoda and Polychaeta.  It also reveals rare species and parasites.  We conclude that Next Generation Sequencing of 18S amplicons is a powerful tool for elucidating the true diversity and species richness of zooplankton communities. While this approach allows for broad diversity assessments of plankton it may become increasingly attractive in future if sequence reference libraries of accurately identified individuals are better populated.",Metagenetic analysis of the 18S nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA gene of a mixed zooplankton assemblage was carried out using the 454 pyrosequencing platform.,SUBMITTED,2018-07-02T12:59:35,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002475/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002475/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002475/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002475/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002475/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002475/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002475,4.1,root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine

Increasing evidence shows the importance of the microbiome in health and disease and inseparable host-microbial dependencies. Host-microbe interactions are highly relevant in patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, (HSCT), i.e. a replacement of the cellular part of the patients' immune system with that of a foreign donor. HSCT is employed as curative immunotherapy for a number of non-malignant and malignant hematologic conditions, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The procedure can be accompanied by severe side effects such as infections, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD), and death. Here, we performed a longitudinal analysis of immunological markers, immune reconstitution and gut microbiota composition in relation to clinical outcomes in children undergoing HSCT. Such an analysis could reveal biomarkers, e.g. at the time point prior to HSCT, that in the future could be used to predict which patients are of high risk in relation to side effects and clinical outcomes and guide treatment strategies accordingly. 

Results:
In two multivariate analyses (sparse partial least squares regression and canonical correspondence analysis), we identified three consistent clusters: (1) High concentrations of the antimicrobial peptide human beta-defensin 2 (hBD2) prior to the transplantation in patients with high abundances of Lactobacillaceae, who later developed moderate or severe aGvHD and exhibited high mortality. (2) Rapid reconstitution of NK and B cells in patients with high abundances of obligate anaerobes such as Ruminococcaceae, who developed no or mild aGvHD and exhibited low mortality. (3) High inflammation, indicated by high levels of C-reactive protein, in patients with high abundances of facultative anaerobic bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae. Furthermore, we observed that antibiotic treatment influenced the bacterial community state.

Conclusions: 
We identify multivariate associations between specific microbial taxa, host immune markers, immune cell reconstitution and clinical outcomes in relation to HSCT. Our findings encourage further investigations into establishing longitudinal surveillance of the intestinal microbiome and relevant immune markers, such as hBD2, in HSCT patients. Profiling of the microbiome may prove useful as a prognostic tool that could help identify patients at risk of poor immune reconstitution and adverse outcomes, such as aGvHD and death, upon HSCT, providing actionable information in guiding precision medicine.",Specific gut microbiome members are associated with distinct immune markers in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,SUBMITTED,2018-06-29T08:41:19,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002447/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002447/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002447/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Circulatory system:Blood', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Circulatory%20system:Blood'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002447/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002447/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002447/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002447,4.1,root:Host-associated:Human:Circulatory system:Blood

Macroalga-derived oligosaccharides are potential prebiotics, and herein, we determined the effects of Laminaria sp.-derived alginate oligosaccharide (AlgOS) on the distal intestinal microbiota of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Using a high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing technique, we investigated the microbiota harboured in the intestinal content and mucus of Atlantic salmon offered feeds supplemented with 0.5 and 2.5% AlgOS. We found that AlgOS shifts the intestinal microbiota profile; alpha diversity was significantly reduced with 2.5% AlgOS while with 0.5% AlgOS the alteration occurred without impacting the bacterial diversity. Beta diversity showed a significant difference between control and AlgOS-fed groups. AlgOS supplementation facilitated the dominance of Proteobacteria and Spirochaetes, promoting the growth of presumed butyrate producers in the intestine. In addition, 0.5% AlgOS stimulated certain bacteria belonging to Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes and Actinobacteria. This indicates that the low inclusion of AlgOS can plausibly induce a prebiotic effect on the distal intestinal microbiota of Atlantic salmon. These results are expected to generate further interest in the potential of macroalgae-derived oligosaccharides as prebiotics for food and feed applications.  ",Alginate oligosaccharide-induced shift in the intestinal microbiota of salmon.,SUBMITTED,2018-06-13T09:22:29,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002413/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002413/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002413/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Fish:Digestive system:Intestine', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Fish:Digestive%20system:Intestine'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002413/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002413/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002413/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002413,4.1,root:Host-associated:Fish:Digestive system:Intestine

As sequencing costs continues to decrease, thorough investigations of the microbiome in the GI tract is now easily accessible. However, several studies have shown large variation between the mucosal and fecal microbiome in humans. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the mucosal microbiome is considered to be the most relevant for the pathogenesis. Mucosal tissue is only accessible during colonoscopy or surgery, and the availability of colon or ileum tissue is therefore the most important limiting factor in microbiome research in IBD. However the access to FFPE-tissue is immense compared to the availability of fresh tissue samples. Aims and methods: To compare the yield from 16srRNA sequencing on frozen tissue vs. FFPE from the same patient. Two patients scheduled for bowel resection because of cancer in the right hemicolon were included in this pilot study. Paired tissue biopsies were taken from the colon and ileum in both patients immediately after surgical bowel resection. One biopsy in the pair was frozen on liquid nitrogen and in -80 C and the other put on formalin for subsequent DNA isolation and sequencing analysis. DNA isolation were performed using Qiagen, QIAamp DNA mini kit for the frozen the tissue and Qiagen, QIAamp DNA FFPE tissue kit for FFPE tissue. 16srRNA sequencing, using Illumina Miseq platform were performed on both frozen tissue and FFPE tissue.",Pilot study comparing yield from 16srRNA sequencing from frozen tissue vs. formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue from the ileum and colon,SUBMITTED,2018-06-12T12:23:53,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002408/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002408/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002408/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002408/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002408/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002408/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002408,4.1,root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system

Previous studies have found large inter-individual variations in mucosal 5-ASA concentrations. Several explanatory models have been proposed, but is remains unintelligible why some patients have high 5-ASA concentrations, while others have low. Previous findings suggest that treatment with Asacol (pH-dependent release formulation) yields higher mucosal 5-ASA concentrations than Pentasa (time-dependent release formulation). The mucosal bacterial composition and fermentation products, such as short chain fatty acids, greatly impact pH-value in the colon and might therefore be correlated to 5-ASA concentration. Aim and method: In this cross-sectional non-randomized study, we have measured mucosal concentration of 5-ASA and its inactive metabolite acetyl-5-ASA (Ac-5-ASA) in the left hemicolon and rectum in patients with quiescent UC taking Mezavant, Asacol or Pentasa. Patients with quiescent UC using oral mesalazine monotherapy in the maximal dose recommended by the manufacturers (4.0-4.8g o.d.) were included. Eight hours after ingestion of mesalazine, patients underwent blood sample collection, followed by bowel preparation with enema and sigmoidoscopy. A total of six mucosal biopsies were collected 10, 25 and 40 cm from the anal verge. 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA concentrations were measured in five biopsies and serum by high-performance liquid chromatography. The mucosal and fecal microbiome was explored using 16srRNA sequencing.

The first symptom of clubroot disease appeared 14 days after inoculation (DAI) and increased drastically between 14 and 35 DAI. The structure of microbial communities associated to rhizosphere soil and root samples was assessed at each sampling date through sequencing of bacterial (16S) and fungal (18S) molecular markers.

The single course had strong and persistent effects on the intestinal microbiome, selecting for a highly metabolically active metagenome, with altered hepatic and serum metabolites. The exposure led to differential ileal and hepatic histone modification, and perturbed ileal gene expression, strongly affecting the normal maturational pattern. Earliest effects involved specific genes in innate immune pathways, with later effects on adaptive immunity. Microbiome analysis revealed four potential T1D-protective taxa and four T1D-accelerating taxa, and a network linking specific microbial taxa to differences in ileal gene expression was identified.

In the current study, we hypothesized that resistant starch (RS)  provided in the maternal diet during gestation and lactation will be fermented in their hindgut, which would favourably modify their milk and/or microbiota composition and that it would in turn affect piglets' microbiota profile and their absorptive and immune abilities. In this experiment, 33% of pea starch was used in the diet of gestating and lactating sows and compared to control sows. Their microbiota and milk composition were determined and the microbiota, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) production and gut health related parameters of the piglets were measured two days before weaning.  In addition, their overall performances and post-weaning faecal score were also assessed. The RS diet modulated the microbiota of the sows during gestation, increasing the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio and the relative abundance of beneficial genera like Bifidobacterium but these differences disappeared during lactation and were not transmitted to the offspring. Milk protein and lactose concentrations were impacted by the diet, without an impact on piglets' bodyweight or diarrhoea frequency post-weaning.  Moreover, the intestinal morphology measured as villus height and crypt depths, and the inflammatory cytokines in the intestine of the piglets were not differentially expressed between maternal treatments.  Only ZO-1 was more expressed in the ileum of piglets born from RS sows, suggesting a better closure of the mucosa tight junctions.

Previous studies have explored some possible contributing factors such as (genetic) relatedness, diet, and developmental stage. A likely additional cause is that our microbial communities are shaped by our unique surroundings, including the individuals with whom we interact at various stages of life. To quantify potential microbial exchange, we surveyed fecal, oral, and skin microbiota from 159 humans and 36 dogs across 60 families consisting of spousal units with children, dogs, both, or neither. Members of the same family, particularly couples, shared more of their microbiota than did individuals from different households, with an especially strong effect of co-habitation on skin compared to oral or fecal microbiota. Dog ownership, but not children, had a significant effect on the extent to which cohabiting adults shared skin (forehead and palm) microbiota, and dog-owning adults shared more microbial taxa with each other than with those who did not. Furthermore, adults shared more skin microbiota with their own dogs than with other dogs.

The development of techniques to exploit samples, which cannot be satisfactorily analysed at present, is driving the field.  High-throughput sequencing techniques have been available for a few years however there are very few examples of their application in forensic science.   This study investigates the potential for bacteria found in the salivary microbiome to be used in a new method for human identification. Two different targets (16S RNA and rpoB) were chosen to maximise coverage of the salivary microbiome and when combined, they increase the power of identification. Paired-end Illumina high-throughput sequencing was used to analyse the bacterial composition of saliva from two different people at four different time points (t=0 and t=28 days and then one year later at t=0 and t=28 days).   Five major phyla dominate the samples: Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria. Streptococcus, a firmicute, is one of the most abundant genera found in saliva and targeting Streptococcus rpoB has enabled a deeper characterisation of the different streptococci species otherwise impossible with 16S rRNA alone. We have observed that samples from the same person group together regardless of time of sampling. However, samples taken one month apart group closer together than those taken one year apart.

We characterized inter- and intra-individual variation of microbial communities in the largest cohort to date (264 saliva samples), using culture-independent 16S rRNA pyrosequencing. We followed the temporal dynamics of their salivary microbiota over 10 years spanning adolescence, and determined the influence of human genotype, gender, age, puberty, and weight class on the microbial communities. Participants included 107 healthy individuals sampled mainly at ages 12-13, 17-18 and 22-24, with a few sampled as early as 8 years of age. In contrast to gut or skin microbiomes, there is a core genus-level salivary microbiome; individuals are more similar to themselves and their co-twins in the 12-17 and in the 17-22 cohorts than to the whole sample population, but not over the 10 years from 12 to 22; and human genotype has no significant role in the oral bacterial composition. The data are most consistent with shared environment serving as the main determinant of microbial populations. Twins resemble each other more closely than the whole population at all time-points, but become less similar to each other when they age and no longer cohabit. Several organisms have age-specific abundance profiles, including members of the genera Veillonella, Actinomyces, and Streptococcus. There is no clear effect of weight class, puberty, and gender.

Rhizosphere microbiome composition is shaped in part by the plant genotype, but the underlying genetic basis is largely unknown. Going back to the roots, we investigated how plant domestication affected rhizosphere microbiome assembly of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), a key food crop worldwide. DArT genotyping and plant phenotyping showed substantial genetic diversity and root architectural differences between ancestral and modern bean accessions grown in Colombian field soil. Bean genotypes affected rhizosphere microbiome composition, with Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia enriched on roots of ancestral beans and Actinobacteria more prevalent on modern beans. Genome-wide association mapping pinpointed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the bean genome associated with the abundance of specific rhizobacterial families.

Recent studies are unravelling the impact of microorganisms from the rhizosphere on such interactions and are gradually changing our perception, but the reverse effect has seldom been investigated. Herbivore attacks on plants could represent important perturbations for belowground communities. Our study aimed at determining how plant herbivory influences resistance and resilience of root and rhizosphere microbial community assemblages and whether potential changes in root metabolites and elemental compounds during herbivory can explain microbial community dynamics. We further questioned the influence of initial soil microbial diversity on these interactions. We conducted our study on a crop plant, oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and one of its major belowground pest, the cabbage root fly (Delia radicum). Soils of different initial microbial diversity were obtained through a removal-recolonization method. Root and rhizosphere sampling targeted different stages of the herbivore development: i) the hatching stage which corresponds to the initiation of herbivory, ii) the third larval instar which corresponds to the peak of herbivory and iii) adult emergence which corresponds to the end of herbivory. Bacterial communities were more affected by herbivory than fungi communities, which appeared very variable. Herbivory was associated to an increase of γ-Proteobacteria and of 5 bacterial dominant genera belonging to this phylum and Firmicutes. Root communities were more resilient than rhizosphere communities. This resilience was partly visible at the root metabolite and nutrient level, which reached back a more stable state at the end of herbivory. But herbivory also induced an increase of sulfur-containing compounds, as well as a couple amino acids and sugars. Three bacterial genera were positively correlated to most metabolites and negatively to nutrients. Further researches would help to identify the biological function of the microbial genera impacted by plant infestation and their potential implication in the plant defense.",Root Herbivory Shapes The Dynamic Of Oilseed Root And Rhizosphere Microbial Communities Through Chemical Changes,SUBMITTED,2018-03-06T12:17:27,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002279/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002279/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002279/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Plants:Rhizosphere', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Plants:Rhizosphere'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002279/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002279/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002279/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002279,4.1,root:Host-associated:Plants:Rhizosphere

System efficiency regarding Fe(II) and As(III) oxidation and As removal was monitored during 19 days. At the end, the mineralogy (As and Fe bearing phases) and bacterial communities in the biogenic precipitate were analyzed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing, respectively. The percentage of Fe(II) oxidation (10–47 %) and As removal (19–37 %) increased with increasing HRT. Arsenic was trapped in the biogenic precipitates as As(III)-bearing schwertmannite and amorphous ferric arsenate, with a decrease of As/Fe ratio with increasing HRT. The bacterial community in the biogenic precipitates differed widely from that of the original feed water. Fe-oxidizing bacteria were dominant whatever the HRT but the proportion of Gallionella and Ferrovum genera shifted notably, from respectively 65 and 12 % at low HRT, to 23 and 51 % at high HRT. This shift was associated with physicochemical changes in pH, dissolved oxygen and Fe(III) concentrations in the treated water. A genetic potential for As(III) oxidation was evidenced through the detection of aioA genes at all HRT and As-oxidizing Thiomonas genera was always present as a minority member of the community but HRT did not appear to control As(III) oxidation in the present experiment.

Fundamental research in this area is however complicated by the timeframe restrictions during which microbe-host interactions can be studied in vitro. The model proposed in this paper consists of an oral epithelium and biofilm to study microbe-host crosstalk in vitro in non-infectious conditions up to 72 h. Microbiota derived from oral swabs were cultured on an agar/mucin layer and challenged with monolayers of keratinocytes grown on plastic or collagen type I layers embedded with fibroblasts. The overall microbial biofilm composition in terms of species diversity remained representative for the oral microbiome, whilst the epithelial cell morphology and viability were unaffected. Applying the model to investigate wound healing revealed a reduced healing of 30% in presence of microbiota, which was not caused by a reduction of the proliferation index (52.1–61.5) or a significantly increased number of apoptotic (1-1.13) or necrotic (32-30.5%) cells. Since the model allows the separate study of the microbial and cellular exometabolome, the biofilm and epithelial characteristics after co-culturing, it is applicable for investigations within fundamental research and for the discovery and development of agents that promote wound healing.",Development of an oral mucosa model to study host-microbiome interactions during wound healing,SUBMITTED,2018-02-16T08:34:18,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002245/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002245/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002245/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Oral', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Oral'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002245/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002245/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002245/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002245,4.1,root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Oral

Reduced saliva flow may lead to changes in the salivary microbiota. These changes have mainly been studied with culture that typically recovers only 65% of the bacteria present.

Objective: This study was to use high throughput sequencing, covering both cultivated and not-yet-cultivated bacteria, to assess the bacterial microbiota of whole saliva in pSS patients with normal salivation.

Methods: Bacteria of whole unstimulated saliva from nine pSS patients with normal salivation flow and from nine healthy controls were examined by high throughput sequencing of the hypervariable region V1V2 of 16S rRNA using the 454 GS Junior system. Raw sequence reads were subjected to a species-level, reference-based taxonomy assignment pipeline specially designed for studying the human oral microbial community. Each of the sequence reads was BLASTN-searched against a database consisting of reference sequences representing 1,156 oral and 12,013 non-oral species. Unassigned reads were then screened for high-quality non-chimeras and subjected to de novo species-level operational taxonomy unit (OTU) calling for potential novel species. Downstream analyses, including alpha and beta diversities, were analyzed using the Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) pipeline. To reveal significant differences between the microbiota of control saliva and Sjögren's saliva, a statistical method introduced in Metastats www.metastats.cbcb.umd.edu was used.

Results: Saliva of pSS patients with normal salivation had a significantly higher frequency of Firmicutes compared with controls (p=0.004). Two other major phyla, Synergistetes and Spirochaetes, were significantly depleted in pSS (p=0.001 for both). In addition, we saw a nearly 17% decrease in the number of genera in pSS (25 vs. 30). While Prevotella was almost equally abundant in both groups (25% in pSS and 22% in controls), about a twofold increase in pSS of Streptococcus (28% vs. 17%) and Veillonella (26% vs. 12%) was detected. Prevotella melaninogenica was the major species in controls (13%) while Veillonella atypica and the Veillonella parvula groups dominated in patient samples (14 and 14%). The scarcity in bacterial species in pSS compared with controls was also demonstrated by alpha and beta diversity analyses, as well as read abundance depicted in a phylogenetic tree.

Conclusions: While Firmicutes was significantly higher in pSS patients than in controls, Synergistetes and Spirochaetes were significantly lower. The number of bacterial genera and species was also lower. These data showed that microbial dysbiosis is another key characteristic of pSS whole saliva which can occur independent of hyposalivation.",MICROBIOLOGICAL AND BIOINFORMATICS ANALYSIS OF PRIMARY SJOGREN'S SYNDROME PATIENTS WITH NORMAL SALIVATION,SUBMITTED,2018-02-15T08:31:00,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002241/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002241/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002241/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Oral:Saliva', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Oral:Saliva'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002241/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002241/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002241/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002241,4.1,root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Oral:Saliva

These infections are polymicrobial with high bacterial diversity.  Understanding the spatial transition of microbiota from normal oral cavities through the infected root canal to the acute periapical abscess can improve our knowledge of the pathogenesis of endodontic infections and lead to more effective treatment. We obtained samples from the oral cavity, infected root canal and periapical abscess of 8 patients (5 with localized and 3 with systemic infections). Microbial populations in these samples were analyzed using next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons. Bioinformatics tools and statistical tests with rigorous criteria were used to elucidate the spatial transition of the microbiota from normal to diseased sites. Results: On average, 10,000 partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained from each sample.  All sequences fell into 11 different bacterial phyla.  The microbial diversity in root canal and abscess samples was significantly lower than in the oral samples.  Streptococcus was the most abundant genus in oral cavities while Prevotella and Fusobacterium were most abundant in diseased samples.  Root canal and periapical abscess microbiota were more similar to each other than to the oral cavity microbiota. Using rigorous criteria and novel bioinformatics tools, we found that Granulicatella adiacens, Eubacterium yurii, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella salivae, Streptococcus mitis, and Atopobium rimae were over-represented in diseased samples.  Conclusions: We used a novel approach and high-throughput methodologies to describe microbial transition from normal to diseased oral sites in the same individuals    Eight patients with root canal infections (5 with systemic infections and 3 with localized infection) undergone treatment.

However, before undertaking large-scale studies, it is necessary to understand the technique-associated limitations and intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem, which may affect our ability to discover disease-associated biomarkers. In this work we evaluated bias in species representation using an in vitro-assembled mock community of oral bacteria. We then sequenced the salivary and buccal mucosa bacterial communities of five healthy subjects to investigate their diversity and differences within and between subjects. Mock community analysis revealed primer and DNA isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Sequencing of salivary and mucosal communities revealed 455 OTUs (0.3% dissimilarity) across all samples with only 78 of the OTUs present in all subjects. Salivary communities were more diverse, with 120-318 OTUs per subject, while in mucosa each subject had 63-136 OTUs. Total OTUs per subject estimated using CatchAll (an estimator that performed well in evenly distributed salivary and also in uneven mucosal communities), ranged from 145-369 for saliva and 111-377 for mucosa. Inter-subject variability in community structure was lower than site differences between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. These differences were evident even at very low sequencing depths and were mainly explained by an over-representation of Streptococcus mitis and Gemella haemolysans in mucosa, while several taxa from the genera Neisseria, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, Fusobacterium, among others, showed higher affinity for saliva.

Using a newly developed ADLPAPT transgenic mouse model that overexpresses human mutant APP/PS1 and mutant tau, we examined the impact of the gut microbiota on AD pathogenesis. The composition of the gut microbiota in ADLPAPT mice differed from that of healthy wild type (WT) mice; these differences appeared in early life of ADLPAPT mice before AD pathogenesis. Also, ADLPAPT mice showed low-grade inflammation, high gut permeability and metabolic endotoxemia. RNA-Seq analysis of colonic tissue revealed that aging-related tissue degeneration and macrophage dysfunction occurred earlier in ADLPAPT mice, compared to WT mice. Interestingly, frequent transfer of fecal microbiota from the WT mice into ADLPAPT mice ameliorated Aβ plaque, neurofibrillary tangle formation and glial reactivity, thereby improving learning behavior in recipient mice. In addition, abnormalities in colonic gene expressions were recovered by fecal microbiota transfer.

Such analysis allows, for example, surveillance of antibiotic-induced changes in pathogen prevalence, the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance, and the transmission of multi-resistant organisms. However, current analytical strategies for understanding these processes are limited. Culture- and PCR-based assays for specific microbes require the a priori selection of targets, while antibiotic sensitivity testing typically provides no insight into either the molecular basis of resistance, or the carriage of resistance determinants by the wider commensal microbiota. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing provides an alternative approach that allows the microbial composition of clinical samples to be described in detail, including the prevalence of resistance genes and virulence traits. While highly informative, the application of metagenomics to large patient cohorts can be prohibitively expensive. Using sputum samples from a randomised placebo-controlled trial of erythromycin in adults with bronchiectasis, we describe a novel, cost-effective strategy for screening patient cohorts for changes in resistance gene prevalence. By combining metagenomic screening of pooled DNA extracts with validatory quantitative PCR-based analysis of candidate markers in individual samples, we identify population-level changes in the relative abundance of specific macrolide resistance genes.

Eight rumen-fistulated steers were fed a roughage hay diet (Rhode grass; Chloris gayana). Four animals received the antimethanogenic compound chloroform (1.6 g choloroform-cyclodextrin /100 kg LW) while the other four received 3-NOP (2.5 g 3-NOP/ animal/ day) for 21 days. Methane reduction compared with control period was similar for both treatments (30 to 38 %) with no differences of H2 expelled between controls and treatments. Daily weight gain was significantly increased when animals were treated with 3-NOP compared with chloroform and control. Regarding the rumen fermentation parameters increases in ammonia, acetate and branched chain fatty acids were observed with both compounds compared with the controls. Also, methylamines, alcohols and dimethylsulfone concentrations were significantly increased with the treatments compared with control. The rumen microbiome analyses revealed a similar profile for both treatments, with a shift in operational taxonomic units (OTUs) assigned to the Prevotellaceae and Campylobacteraceae family. Moreover, major archaeal OTUs associated with Methanobrevibacter and Methanosphaera were significantly affected to varying extents based on the inhibitory treatments compared to the control. Also the abundance of the Methanobrevibacter spp was decreased by 3-NOP and chloroform, while the Methanomassiliicoccaceae family was inhibited only by 3-NOP. The results suggest that despite the specific mode of action of 3-NOP on methanogens, inhibition of methanogenesis by both compounds resulted in similar responses in metabolism and microbial community structure in the rumen. We hypothesized that these changes were driven by the redirection of metabolic hydrogen by both treatments. Therefore results from previous publications using chloroform as an inhibitor of methanogenesis may be useful in predicting rumen microbiome and fermentation responses to 3-NOP.","Responses in Methane Production, Rumen metabolism and Microbial Community in Tropical Adapted Cattle Fed 3-Nitrooxypropanol",SUBMITTED,2018-01-25T09:00:55,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002179/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002179/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002179/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Mammals:Digestive system:Stomach:Rumen', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Mammals:Digestive%20system:Stomach:Rumen'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002179/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002179/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002179/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002179,4.1,root:Host-associated:Mammals:Digestive system:Stomach:Rumen

Automated ribosomal inter-genic spacer analysis (ARISA), and High Throughput Sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons were used to analyze samples collected from the bioreactors over time to detect the persistence of the inoculated bacteria within the autochthonous communities, and to compare communities in the bioreactors. Furthermore, the abundance of total bacteria (16S rRNA gene) and biodesulfurization potential (dszA) were estimated using qPCR, in the bioreactors and on GTR before the treatment. ARISA showed that G. desulfuricans DSM 44462T was able to persist, while there are no clear evidences of Rhodococcus sp AF21875 persistence into the bioreactor due to the presence of matching ARISA fragments in the untreated GTR. In both bioreactors, a high abundance of genus Gordonia and Rhodococcus was observed, with an increase of dszA copy numbers over time.

With advances in sequencing technologies comprehensive studies to elucidate bacterial community differences have recently become possible. We used 454 sequencing of 16S rDNA to compare subgingival bacterial communities from 29 periodontally healthy controls and 29 subjects with chronic periodontitis. Amplicons from both the V1-2 and V4 regions of the 16S gene were sequenced, yielding 1,393,579 sequences. They were identified by BLAST against a curated oral 16S database, and mapped to 16 phyla, 106 genera, and 596 species. 81% of sequences could be mapped to cultivated species. Differences between health- and periodontitis-associated bacterial communities were observed at all phylogenetic levels, and UniFrac and PCoA showed distinct community profiles in health and disease. Community diversity was higher in disease, and 123 species were identified that were significantly more abundant in disease, and 53 in health. Spirochaetes, Synergistetes, and Bacteroidetes were more abundant in disease, while the Proteobacteria were found at higher levels in healthy controls. Within the phylum Firmicutes, the class Bacilli was health-associated, while the Clostridia, Negativicutes, and Erysipelotrichia were associated with disease. These results implicate a number of taxa that will be targets for future research. Some, such as Filifactor alocis and many spirochetes were represented by a large fraction of sequences as compared to previously identified targets.

The effects of yoga or LFD intervention on the gut microbiota in patients with irritable bowel syndrome was examined for correlations between both treatment options.Methods: Fifty-nine patients with IBS undertook a single-blind, randomized controlled trial involving a yoga or LFD intervention. Bacterial abundance was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing at baseline and after 12 weeks using operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Results: LFD resulted in reduction of the overall relative abundance of Firmicutes, especially of the genus Blautia. This was matched by an increase in the relative abundance of bacteria belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes. This observation appears also as a weak, but not statistically significant trend in the yoga group. Few OTUs showed a similar response to yoga and LFD. The most pronounced was a decrease observed in the family Lachnospiraceae, namely Eubacterium hallii, Blautia wexlerae and Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans.Conclusions: This study suggests that both, yoga and LFD can change the microbiota for some OTUs in a similar way. The reduction in the abundance of Firmicutes in LFD might unfold its effects through a direct change in the gut bacteria composition. In constrast, yoga might indirectly act on the microbiome through the parasympathetic nervous system, which paralleled the effects of LFD for some Lachnospiraceae species.

However, the key microbes involved in choline-dependent methanogenesis remain poorly characterized and the metabolic pathways by which the saltmarsh microbes degrade choline and form methane are yet to be determined. In this study, we combined DNA stable isotope probing microcosms with high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and 13C2-choline enriched metagenomes, followed by binning of the microbial population genomes to identify the microbes responsible for methanogenesis. Microcosm incubation with 13C2-choline leads to the formation of trimethylamine and subsequent methane production, suggesting that choline-dependent methanogenesis is a two-step process involving trimethylamine as the key intermediate. Amplicon sequencing analysis identified Deltaproteobacteria, of the genera Pelobacter and Desulfuromonas were the major choline-utilizers. The methanogenic Archaea, of the genera Methanococcoides became enriched in choline-amended microcosms, indicating their role in methane formation from trimethylamine. The binning of the microbial population genomes from metagenomic DNA resulted in the identification of bins that are classified as Pelobacter, Desulfuromonas, Methanococcoides and their associated viruses. Analyses of these bins revealed that Pelobacter and Desulfuromonas have the genetic potential to degrade choline to trimethylamine using the choline-trimethylamine lyase pathway, whereas Methanococcoides are capable of methanogenesis using the pyrrolysine-containing trimethylamine methyltransferase pathway.",Metagenome data from DNA stable isotope probing of Stiffkey saltmarsh sediment microcosms to investigate methanogenesis from choline,SUBMITTED,2017-12-18T16:34:56,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002088/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002088/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002088/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Intertidal zone:Salt marsh', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Intertidal%20zone:Salt%20marsh'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002088/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002088/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002088/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002088,4.0|4.1,root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Intertidal zone:Salt marsh

The analysis of the reads indicated that the oral cavity is functionally a different environment from the gut, with many functional categories enriched in one of the two environments and depleted in the other. Individuals who had never suffered from dental caries showed an over-representation of several functional categories, like genes for antimicrobial peptides and quorum sensing.

Examining baseline variation within and between individuals over time is critical to understanding this disease transition. Here we examined the temporal stability of supragingival plaque, tongue dorsum, and salivary microbial communities of healthy individuals. Ten subjects were sampled over 90 days and oral bacterial communities were profiled by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In all cases, supragingival plaque consortia were distinct from tongue dorsum and salivary communities. Overall, 97% of bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) found in saliva were also detected in tongue samples, whereas only 2% of salivary OTUs were associated with supragingival plaque. Relative to other sites, the tongue dorsum also exhibited the highest relative temporal stability in bacterial composition. Because of the temporal variability in intra-individual microbiota, pooling of data from at least three time-points was required to capture the majority of an individual?s diversity at all time points. Using machine learning, we could also identify each subject by their microbial profiles alone with 95% accuracy, owing to each individual?s distinct oral microbial profiles. We also identified a core set of bacterial OTUs from all samples that classified within six genera: Streptococcus, Fusobacterium, Haemophilus, Neisseria, Prevotella, and Rothia. A set of 14 additional core OTUs were present in the majority of subjects, sites, and time-points, affiliated with the Campylobacter, Bergeyella, and Porphyromonas genera. This study characterizing a baseline and examining temporal shifts of the healthy core microbiota provides an useful prospect to examine dysbiosis during disease. While this knowledge can be harnessed to develop novel prognostics and diagnostics for disease conditions, the intra-individual differences in oral microbiota also highlight the need for an individualized approach to bacterial surveillance in dentistry.","Temporal stability of the oral microbiota: A longitudinal study of the dental, tongue, and salivary bacterial consortia",SUBMITTED,2016-06-13T10:46:58,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001068/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001068/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001068/downloads,1,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Oral', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Oral'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001068/biomes,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001068/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001068/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001068,2.0|4.1,root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Oral

Samples were taken off the coast of Algarve, South Portugal (North-east Atlantic), and subjected to Illumina sequencing after microbial metagenomic DNA extraction.

In contrast, the dominant phyla in seawater were Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria (89.3% of all classifiable reads), whereas sediments were dominated by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes (85%). We found significantly higher frequencies of transcription and translation termination factors in sediments and seawater, respectively, than in marine sponge microbial metagenomes. Moreover, higher abundances of motility and chemotaxis gene reads were found in the former microhabitats in comparison with the marine sponge microbiome, where a conspicuously higher frequency of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats (CRISPRs), accompanied by much lower viral abundance, was otherwise observed.

Hydrocarbons can accidentally reach soil and sediments and distribute underground, likely affecting the biota and causing changes in bacterial communities.
